## 7. Data Quality Issues Found

### ⚠️ Minor: Attack Effect Details Missing
Some attack effects are not captured in the CSV (only damage is shown).

**Example**: 
- Charizard ex "Stoke" shows as `: ` but doesn't include the effect text
- This is acceptable - the card_url links to full details

**Impact**: LOW - card URLs provide complete information

### Recommendation
For a future enhancement, could add an `attack_effects` column to capture effect descriptions.
