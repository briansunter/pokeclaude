4. Analyzes composition (`analyze_deck`)

**Deck List Generated**:
```
Pokemon (15):
- Charizard ex x2
- Charmander x2
- Charmeleon x2
- Moltres ex x2
- Arcanine ex x2
- Growlithe x2
- Rapidash x1

Mewtwo ex is weak to: Darkness

Top Counters:
1. Weavile ex (140 HP, Darkness type)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Find Fire type Pokemon with 100+ HP" works better than "Find good Fire cards"

2. **Use Prompts**: Type `/build-deck mainCard="Mewtwo ex"` for guided workflows

3. **Combine Tools**: Claude will automatically chain tools:
   - Search ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Suggest ‚Üí Optimize

4. **Ask Follow-ups**: "Now find counters to that deck" - Claude remembers context

5. **SQL Power Users**: "Run a query to find..." and Claude uses `query_cards`
