### Deck-Specific Mulligan Guidelines

#### Charizard ex (Red Boost) Mulligans

**Always Keep If:**

- ‚úÖ Charmander or Charmeleon in play (evolution line intact)
- ‚úÖ At least 2 fire energy in opening hand
- ‚úÖ Path to turn 2 Charizard (energy + evolve on turn 2)
- ‚úÖ 1-2Professor's Research for consistency

**Always Mulligan If:**

- ‚ùå No fire Basics or energy (can't win without Red Boost)
- ‚ùå Only 1 card total (can't establish board or draw)
- ‚ùå 4+ non-energy cards (too slow, can't accelerate)
- ‚ùå Only Zapdos or pidgey as opener (no Zard line)

**Marginal Keep (Conditional):**

- üî∂ 1 fire energy + 1 Pok√© Ball (60% to find second energy)
- üî∂ Red Card in hand (disrupt opponent, buy time to draw)
- üî∂ Pair of basics without energy (if opponent is also slow)

#### Blaziken ex (Fire Rush) Mulligans

**Always Keep If:**

- ‚úÖ Torchic on turn 1 (can evolve Blaziken turn 2 with 1 energy)
- ‚úÖ 2+ fire energy in hand
- ‚úÖ Blaziken ex already in play (immediate pressure)
- ‚úÖ 1 Professor's + 1 draw supporter (Card draw is crucial)

**Always Mulligan If:**

- ‚ùå No fire Basics or only Combusken (can't evolve without Charmander line)
- ‚ùå 3+ Fire Energy with no Basics (wasted resources)
- ‚ùå Only Mill/control cards, no attackers
- ‚ùå 5+ non-Pokemon cards (too slow)

**Marginal Keep:**

- üî∂ Combusken + Fire Energy (can become Blaziken turn 2, but needs turn 3 evolution)
- üî∂ Welder + Nidoqueen (control line, slow but stable)

#### Mewtwo ex (Psychic Shield) Mulligans

**Always Keep If:**

- ‚úÖ Mewtwo ex in play (even without energy, threatens turn 3)
- ‚úÖ Psychic or future energy + draw support
- ‚úÖ 2+ psychic energy (can power up turn 2)
- ‚úÖ Multiple Mewtwo variants (redundancy)

**Always Mulligan If:**

- ‚ùå No Mewtwo ex or psychic energy (can't execute game plan)
- ‚ùå Only bulk up/energy without attackers
- ‚ùå 4+ trainers with no Pokemon
- ‚ùå Dead hand (all energy, no Pokemon to use them)

**Marginal Keep:**

- üî∂ Misty + energy (can search for Mewtwo next turn)
- üî∂ Single psychic energy + 2 Professor's (high draw potential)

### Advanced Mulligan Math

**Expected Value Calculations:**

_Opening hand quality scores (1-10 scale):_

**Charizard ex Optimal (Score 9-10):**

- Charmander + 2 fire energy = 9
- Charmander + 1 fire energy + Pok√© Ball = 8
- Charmeleon + 1 fire energy = 9

**Charizard ex Average (Score 6-8):**

- 2 fire energy + 1 Professor's = 7
- Charmander + 1 fire energy + 1 draw card = 6
- Any basic + 2 fire energy + 1 Professor's = 8

**Charizard ex Unplayable (Score 1-5):**

- No fire energy = 2
- 4+ non-energy cards = 3
- Only trainers = 1
- Opponent has perfect curve, you have 0-1 cards = 1

**Rule:** Keep hands scoring 6+ if your deck mulligans poorly. Keep hands scoring 8+ always.

## Turn-by-Turn Optimization

### Standard Game Flow Timeline

**Turn Structure Reminder:**

- Turn 1: No attack, no energy placement (only Pokemon search/play)
- Turn 2: Place 1 energy, attack with 1-energy requirement (if possible)
- Turn 3+: Normal play, place 1 energy, attack

### Turn 1 Decision Tree

```
TURN 1 - SETUP PHASE
         |
    [Is your opponent going first?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [They cannot attack - YOU CONTROL PACE]
         |
        [Is your opponent playing aggressively?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [Play defensive Basic, save energy for turn 2]
         |
        NO  ---‚ü∂ [Play your strongest attacker or setup piece]

         |
        NO (You go first) ---‚ü∂ [Setup for turn 2 pressure]
         |
        [Do you have energy acceleration?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [Place 2nd energy if Blaziken/Zard, 1 energy otherwise]
         |
        NO  ---‚ü∂ [Place 1 energy on best attacker, prepare for turn 2]

    [General Turn 1 Priorities by Deck Archetype:]
    1. AGGRO (Zard, Blaziken): Any attacker in play with 1 energy
    2. MIDRANGE (Salamence): Best attacker + 1 energy
    3. CONTROL (Mewtwo): Defensive Pokemon or setup piece
    4. COMBO: Search pieces, defensive positioning
```

**Aggressive Deck Turn 1 Goals:**

- ‚úÖ Get ANY Pokemon in play with 1 energy (Charmander, Torchic)
- ‚úÖ If perfect hand (evolve line + energy): Take momentum
- ‚úÖ Consider bench positioning vs. expected opponent plays
- ‚ùå Don't waste turn 1 drawing cards (you only get 3 cards turn 1)

**Control Deck Turn 1 Goals:**

- ‚úÖ Stabilize vs. aggro matchups (Misty's/Trainer Court defenders)
- ‚úÖ Find setup pieces (Pok√© Ball for energy search)
- ‚úÖ Deny opponent momentum (Professor's to redraw)
- ‚ùå Don't play passive Pokemon into expected removal

### Turn 2 Decision Tree

```
TURN 2 - FIRST ATTACK OPPORTUNITY
         |
    [Can you attack this turn?]
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ [Setup for turn 3]
         |      [Prioritize: Evolve Pokemon, place energy]
         |      [If can't attack: Position for future]
         |
        YES
         |
    [Is your Pokemon viable to attack with?]
         |
        YES
         |
        [Is opponent's active Pokemon threatening you?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [Attack to deny their setup]
         |      [Switch if possible, trade damage]
         |
        NO  ---‚ü∂ [What is opponent's likely play next turn?]
                 |
                [They can KO you?] ---‚ü∂ [Switch/retreat to survive]
                 |
                [They can't KO you?] ---‚ü∂ [Build advantage, don't overcommit]

    [Attack Priorities:]
    1. KO opponent's Pokemon to deny evolution lines
    2. Deny opponent's energy placement (50 damage)
    3. Build your own board (accumulate advantage)
    4. Deny opponent's Benched threats (50 damage)

    [Strategic Considerations:]
    - You will get 2 cards next turn (card advantage)
    - Turn 3 is when games typically "snowball"
    - Energy is critical - don't waste free energy
    - Track opponent's hand size to assess threats
```

### Turn 3 Decision Tree

```
TURN 3 - GAME SCALING DECISION POINT
         |
    [What is your current board state?]
         |
    AHEAD (2+ prizes, strong position)
         |
        [Can you close the game?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [PRESS ADVANTAGE]
         |      [Prioritize: Attack face, don't trade]
         |      [If opponent plays Pokemon: Attack them]
         |
        NO  ---‚ü∂ [CONTROL THE GAME]
                 [Deny opponent's setup, maintain pressure]
                 [Make efficient trades, build inevitability]

    BEHIND (0-1 prizes, weak position)
         |
        [Are you on a clock?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [ALL-IN RACING]
         |      [Aggressive attacks, ignore defense]
         |      [Prioritize: Prize denial, tempo]
         |
        NO  ---‚ü∂ [STABILIZE]
                 [Defensive plays, find comeback pieces]
                 [Switch to energy advantage plays]

    EVEN (1 prize each, balanced position)
         |
        [What deck are you playing?]
         |
        AGGRO ---‚ü∂ [FIND CLOSING LINES]
         |      [Pressure is your win condition]
         |
        CONTROL ---‚ü∂ [OUTCARD OPPONENT]
         |      [Card advantage will win]
         |
        MIDRANGE ---‚ü∂ [ASSESS OPPONENT'S PLAN]
         |      [Adapt to their strategy]
         |      [Usually aggressive into control]
```

### Mid-Game (Turns 4-6) Optimization

**Position Assessment:**

_Are you ahead, behind, or even?_

**If AHEAD:**

- ‚úÖ Prioritize efficient trades (2-for-1 exchanges)
- ‚úÖ Deny opponent's evolution lines
- ‚úÖ Attack benched Pokemon to prevent setup
- ‚úÖ Calculate exact KO ranges for next turns
- ‚ùå Don't overcommit into mass removal
- ‚ùå Don't waste damage on already-stable Pokemon

**If BEHIND:**

- ‚úÖ Find one-card win conditions (Professor's Research, boss's orders)
- ‚úÖ Switch to race plan (ignore defense, go face)
- ‚úÖ Take risky draws (hope for perfect topdecks)
- ‚ùå Don't make fair trades (you can't win those)
- ‚ùå Don't play into opponent's Gust of Wind

**If EVEN:**

- ‚úÖ Force opponent to make first mistake
- ‚úÖ Play reactively, punish overcommits
- ‚úÖ Draw more cards (Pokedex, Professor's Research)
- ‚ùå Don't race unless you have clear advantage
- ‚ùå Don't be the first to commit resources

## Reading Opponent Patterns

### Hand Size Tells

**Critical Insight:** Track opponent's hand size after every turn.

**Hand Size 7+ (Excellent Draw):**

- Opponent has options
- Expect: Threats, disruption, or answers
- Your play: Play around Professor's Research (big swings)
- Don't overcommit board (they can punish with superior hand)
- Consider: Red Card to disrupt their draw

**Hand Size 4-6 (Average Draw):**

- Opponent has reasonable options
- Expect: Solid plays, some flexibility
- Your play: Play your game plan
- Don't be overly aggressive or passive

**Hand Size 1-3 (Poor Draw, Desperate):**

- Opponent has limited options
- Expect: Topdeck reliance, all-in plays
- Your play: Pressure them, don't give breathing room
- They WILL draw perfectly eventually
- Force them to make the first mistake

**Hand Size 0 (Mulled/Whiffed):**

- Opponent drew zero cards turn 1
- This is rare but game-changing
- They likely have only 1 Pokemon in play
- Your play: Attack immediately, don't give them turn 2
- They cannot defend or counter

### Play Pattern Recognition

#### Pattern 1: The Slow Start

**What you'll see:**

- Turn 1: Weak basic or search card
- Turn 2: Basic Pokemon without energy
- Turn 3: Playing catch-up, still behind

**What this means:**

- Opponent's deck is inconsistent OR
- Opponent has wrong mulligan OR
- Opponent is keeping a slow hand to beat control

**Your response:**

- üöÄ **ACCELERATE IMMEDIATELY**
- If aggro: Take initiative, never give it back
- If control: Don't let them stabilize, pressure

#### Pattern 2: The Fast Curve

**What you'll see:**

- Turn 1: Attacker with energy
- Turn 2: Evolution or second attacker
- Turn 3: Multiple threats established

**What this means:**

- Opponent has optimal draw
- You are now playing from behind
- You need to either race or disrupt

**Your response:**

- üìä **ASSESS WIN CONDITION**
- Can you race? ‚Üí All-in attack plan
- Can you disrupt? ‚Üí Professor's, Red Card, gust effects
- Are you faster? ‚Üí Switch lanes, race them

#### Pattern 3: The Stall

**What you'll see:**

- Playing defenders like Pidgey
- Using Misty's/Trainer Court
- Avoiding trades
- Drawing multiple cards per turn

**What this means:**

- Opponent is control/combo oriented
- They want long game
- They will eventually draw perfect hand

**Your response:**

- ‚ö° **DETERMINE CLOSING SPEED**
- Can you win in next 3 turns? ‚Üí Race plan
- Can you disrupt their draw? ‚Üí Aggressive pressure
- Are you slower? ‚Üí Find tempo disruption

#### Pattern 4: The Disruption

**What you'll see:**

- Red Card early
- Professor's Research to dump hand
- Attacking your benched Pokemon
- Switching your active Pokemon

**What this means:**

- Opponent knows your deck's game plan
- They are targeting your key pieces
- You need backup plans

**Your response:**

- üõ°Ô∏è **PROTECT YOUR WIN CONDITION**
- Don't overcommit to single Pokemon
- Have backup attackers
- Force them to expend resources

### Deck Archetype Identification (First 3 Turns)

**After Turn 1, you should know:**

- Opponent's deck type 85% accuracy
- Their game plan (aggro/control/midrange)
- Your optimal response strategy

**Turn 1 tells:**

_Aggressive decks show:_

- Immediate energy placement
- Basic attacker (not setup Pokemon)
- No card draw focus

_Control decks show:_

- Search/filter cards (Pok√© Ball)
- Defensive positioning
- Multi-card plays

_Midrange decks show:_

- Flexible cards
- Evolution lines (can pivot)
- Resource efficiency

---

## Tempo vs. Race Decisions

### The Fundamental Choice

Every turn after turn 3, you must decide: **Tempo or Race?**

**TEMPO PLAY:** Control the pace, make efficient trades, build advantage
**RACE PLAY:** Ignore defense, go face, try to win before opponent's plan completes

### Decision Tree: Should I Race?

```
DO I HAVE A CLEAR RACE WINDOW?
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ PLAY TEMPO
         |
        YES
         |
    [Can I deal 3+ damage this turn?]
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ PLAY TEMPO (can't race without damage)
         |
        YES
         |
    [Can opponent KO me before I win?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ ASSESS RISK
         |      [Do they have 2+ attackers?] ---‚ü∂ PLAY TEMPO
         |      [Are they at 1-2 energy?] ---‚ü∂ CONSIDER RACE
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ RACE IMMEDIATELY
                 (You win before they can respond)

    [Calculate race turns:]
    Opponent's current damage + your next attack
    vs
    Your current damage + opponent's next attack

    [Rule of Thumb:]
    If you need 2 fewer attacks to win ‚Üí RACE
    If you need the same number of attacks ‚Üí TEMPO
    If you need more attacks to win ‚Üí TEMPO
```

### When to Choose TEMPO

**You should ALWAYS play tempo if:**

1. **You are behind on cards** (opponent has more options)
   - Tempo = force opponent to use resources
   - Eventually they'll run out of cards before you

2. **Opponent's deck is faster than yours**
   - You cannot race a Charizard with Mewtwo ex
   - You must disrupt their fast plan

3. **You have inevitability** (your deck is stronger late game)
   - Example: Multiple Mewtwo ex, can rebuild after trades
   - Late game is YOUR game

4. **You can 2-for-1** (trade efficiently)
   - Attack their attacker with your defender
   - Then they waste a turn rebuilding
   - You maintain tempo advantage

5. **Opponent is playing to the same race**
   - If both players race, you need advantage
   - Tempo forces them to change plan

**Tempo Play Principles:**

‚úÖ Attack their active Pokemon (can't attack you back while recovering)
‚úÖ Attack their benched threats (prevent setup)
‚úÖ Make them use energy defensively (waste their turns)
‚úÖ Force inefficient trades (make them overpay)
‚úÖ Build card advantage through superior positioning

‚ùå Don't attack face if they can trade profitably
‚ùå Don't let them establish multiple threats
‚ùå Don't waste damage on already-damaged Pokemon
‚ùå Don't overcommit (play around removal, gust effects)

### When to Choose RACE

**You should ALWAYS race if:**

1. **You are faster than opponent's plan**
   - You can win in 2-3 turns
   - They need 4-5 turns to establish

2. **Opponent has committed to tempo**
   - They've played passively
   - They're setting up for long game
   - You have closing speed

3. **You have a clock** (time pressure)
   - Opponent is control deck, will outdraw you
   - You MUST win before they stabilize
   - Every turn you wait gives them more options

4. **You are behind and can't come back with tempo**
   - You're at 2-0 or worse
   - They have better position
   - Racing gives you 20% chance vs 5% tempo

5. **You drew perfectly, they didn't**
   - You have 3+ attackers on board
   - They have 1-2 weak Pokemon
   - Strike while the iron is hot

**Race Play Principles:**

‚úÖ Go face whenever possible
‚úÖ Attack their Pokemon only if it delays your win
‚úÖ Don't waste turns on defense
‚úÖ Force them to make blocks they don't want to make
‚úÖ Calculate exact KO ranges each turn

‚ùå Don't attack their benched Pokemon (waste time)
‚ùå Don't play defensive cards (you're not playing defense)
‚ùå Don't preserve resources for later (later doesn't exist)
‚ùå Don't play into their gust of wind effects

### Situational Race Calculations

**Scenario 1:**

- You: 1 prize, 90 damage on board, 40 damage on Charizard ex
- Opponent: 0 prizes, 70 damage on board, 50 damage on Pidgey
- Turn: Your turn, Charizard can attack for 60 damage
- Your Charizard has 10 damage on it

**Calculate:**

- If you race: Charizard attacks for 60 ‚Üí 130 damage total, opponent takes 2nd prize
- Opponent's turn: Can they KO your Charizard? NO (10 damage only)
- Next turn: Charizard attacks again ‚Üí 190 damage total ‚Üí YOU WIN
- **Decision: RACE** (you win in 2 turns, they can't stop you)

**Scenario 2:**

- You: 1 prize, 60 damage on opponent's active
- Opponent: 1 prize, 50 damage on your active
- Turn: Your turn, you can do 50 damage to win prize
- Opponent's Mewtwo ex has 30 damage, can do 60 next turn

**Calculate:**

- If you race: Attack face for 50 ‚Üí opponent takes prize (2-1)
- Opponent's turn: KO your active (2-0), you lose
- If you tempo: Attack their Mewtwo (prevent prize), trade damage
- **Decision: TEMPO** (racing loses you the game)

**Scenario 3:**

- You: 0 prizes, Blaziken ex with 2 energy (can do 80 damage)
- Opponent: 2 prizes, 30 damage on their Pokemon, threatening KO
- Turn: Your turn
- If you attack face: Take 1 prize, opponent takes 2nd prize ‚Üí YOU LOSE
- If you attack their Pokemon: Take 1 prize, opponent takes 1 prize ‚Üí Still behind
- But: Your Blaziken can evolve next turn, do 120 damage

**Calculate:**

- Option A (Race): Attack face ‚Üí 1-2 score, lose next turn
- Option B (Tempo): Attack their Pokemon ‚Üí 1-2 score, evolve for 120 next turn ‚Üí WIN
- **Decision: TEMPO** (you can rebuild and win in 2 turns, not lose immediately)

---

## Deck-Specific Sequencing

### Charizard ex (Red Boost) - Perfect Sequencing

**Critical Principles:**

- Red Boost is your ONLY win condition
- Without it, you're weak to everything
- Protect your evolution line at all costs

**Opening Sequence:**

```
TURN 1 (Going First):
Priority: Get Charmander in play with 1 fire energy
Best: Charmander + fire energy = 8/10
Second: Just Charmander = 6/10 (need energy search turn 2)
Don't: Only energy, no Pokemon = 2/10

TURN 2:
Priority: Evolve to Charmeleon + place 2nd fire energy
Goal: Have Charizard in play by turn 3
If you have Charizard: Place 2 energy, prepare Red Boost
If you have Charmeleon: Add 2nd energy, ready to evolve
If you have only Charmander: Add 1st energy, extend to turn 3

TURN 3:
Priority: CHARIZARD WITH 2 ENERGY (ready for Red Boost)
Red Boost sequence: 1st energy ‚Üí Red Boost ‚Üí 2nd energy ‚Üí attack
This deals massive damage: Base 100 + energy boost
Vs aggro: Red Boost turn 3 is usually lethal
Vs control: Red Boost turn 4 with backup is safer

TURN 4+:
Goal: Multiple Charizards with Red Boost
- Each additional Charizard = massive damage
- Opponent cannot respond to multiple threats
- Only stop if: Opponent has exact KO and you can't protect
```

**Red Boost Activation Math:**

_Damage calculation:_

- Charizard ex base: 50 damage
- Red Boost: +30 per fire energy
- 2 fire energy = 80 damage (strong, trades with most Pokemon)
- 3 fire energy = 110 damage (late-game KO threat)
- 4+ fire energy = LETHAL to most things

_When to activate:_

- Turn 3: 2 energy (80 damage) - Standard play
- Turn 4: 3 energy (110 damage) - If opponent stabilized
- Turn 5+: 4+ energy if opponent still alive (rare)

**Advanced Tech Lines:**

**Line 1: The Rush (vs slow decks)**

- Turn 1: Charmander + 1 energy
- Turn 2: Evolve Charmeleon + 1 energy (2 total)
- Turn 3: Charizard + Red Boost immediately
- Turn 4: Attack for 80 damage
- Turn 5: Close game

**Line 2: The Tank (vs aggro decks)**

- Turn 1: Charmander (hold energy for protection)
- Turn 2: Stay Charmander, place 1st energy
- Turn 3: Charizard + 2nd energy (skip Red Boost to survive)
- Turn 4: Red Boost + attack (now you have both offense and defense)

**Line 3: The Multi-Threat (vs control decks)**

- Turn 1: Charmander
- Turn 2: Charmeleon
- Turn 3: Charizard
- Turn 4: Red Boost + attack
- Turn 5: Add second Charizard for backup
- Opponent cannot remove both at once

**Matchup-Specific Sequencing:**

**Vs Blaziken (Fire Mirror):**

- Both going first: Whoever gets Red Boost first wins
- Both going second: You have advantage (more setup time)
- Key: Don't trade early (burn advantage vs burn advantage = loser)
- Prioritize: Red Boost activation over tempo

**Vs Mewtwo (Psychic):**

- Mewtwo's Psychic Shield reduces Charizard damage
- You need MORE energy to punch through
- Your 50 damage base becomes crucial
- Must get multiple Charizards (50 x 3 = 150 even with reduction)

**Vs Pikachu (Electric):**

- Pikachu dies to 1 hit at any reasonable energy
- Just need to connect once
- Don't overthink: Get Charizard, attack, win

### Blaziken ex (Fire Rush) - Perfect Sequencing

**Critical Principles:**

- Fire Rush accelerates your energy for future turns
- You're the FASTEST deck in the format
- Turn 2 Blaziken is your power play

**Opening Sequence:**

```
TURN 1 (Going First):
Priority: Torchic with 1 fire energy = 10/10
This is your PERFECT start
Second best: Any fire Basic = 7/10
Never: No fire Basics = 2/10

TURN 2:
Priority: Evolve to Blaziken ex + place 2nd fire energy
This creates Fire Rush: +10 damage to future attacks
Now your Pokemon have: Base 60 + Fire Rush bonus
Vs weak Pokemon: 60 + Fire Rush = 1HKO
Vs strong Pokemon: Need 2 hits

TURN 3:
Priority: Attack immediately with Blaziken
You have 2 energy, can do 60+ damage
Use Fire Rush bonus to trade efficiently
If opponent's Pokemon is weak: KO it, take prize
If opponent's Pokemon is strong: Trade damage, set up next turn

TURN 4+:
Goal: Maintain energy advantage
Fire Rush means your future Pokemon enter with bonus damage
Play additional attackers with bonus
Opponent cannot keep up with your energy curve
```

**Fire Rush Timing:**

_Optimal activation:_

- Turn 2: Evolve Blaziken + 2nd energy = Fire Rush online
- Turn 3+: Every new Pokemon gets +10 damage immediately
- This compound advantage is how you snowball

_Energy management:_

- You want 2-3 energy on board always
- Fire Rush rewards energy placement
- Don't waste turns drawing cards (you need tempo)

**Advanced Tech Lines:**

**Line 1: The Explosion (vs slow decks)**

- Turn 1: Torchic + energy
- Turn 2: Blaziken + energy (Fire Rush online)
- Turn 3: Attack for 60 (bigger than expected)
- Turn 4: Add Combusken or second Blaziken (also gets Fire Rush)
- Turn 5+: Multiple attackers, each with bonus damage

**Line 2: The Stability (vs aggro mirrors)**

- Turn 1: Torchic + energy
- Turn 2: Blaziken + energy
- Turn 3: DON'T attack face yet, set up backup
- Turn 4: Attack when you have 2 threats ready
- If opponent rushes, you have counterpunch

**Line 3: The Switch (when behind)**

- Turn 1: Weak basic (deception)
- Turn 2: Blaziken from hand (sudden power)
- Opponent didn't see it coming
- You steal initiative on turn 2

**Matchup-Specific Sequencing:**

**Vs Charizard:**

- You are faster: Exploit this
- Don't let them stabilize
- Fire Rush on turn 2 = they need turn 3 Red Boost
- You attack turn 3, they defend turn 3 ‚Üí You get initiative

**Vs Mewtwo:**

- Mewtwo's shield reduces damage
- Fire Rush helps overcome this
- You need multiple attackers (Mewtwo can remove one)
- Keep pressure: can't let Mewtwo power up

**Vs Pikachu:**

- Fast deck vs fast deck
- Who gets online first wins
- Fire Rush gives you slight edge (energy efficiency)
- Don't trade fairly: go face

### Mewtwo ex (Psychic Shield) - Perfect Sequencing

**Critical Principles:**

- Psychic Shield = damage reduction for ALL your Pokemon
- You are the CONTROL deck, not the aggro deck
- Late game is where you shine

**Opening Sequence:**

```
TURN 1 (Going First):
Priority: Any Mewtwo ex variant = 9/10
Even without energy, threatens turn 3 power-up
Second: Psychic energy + search = 7/10
Third: Defensive positioning = 5/10
Never: Only trainers = 2/10

TURN 2:
Priority: Mewtwo ex with 1 psychic energy
This sets up Psychic Shield for turn 3
Shield reduces ALL incoming damage by 20
Now you can trade efficiently
If no Mewtwo: Search for one with energy

TURN 3:
Priority: Power up Mewtwo with 2nd energy
Psychic Shield is now active (20 damage reduction)
Your Mewtwo ex now takes 20 less damage
Opponent needs 2+ hits to KO you
This is your tempo swing turn

TURN 4+:
Goal: Maintain Psychic Shield advantage
Your Pokemon are now tankier than expected
Trade damage efficiently
Force opponent to overcommit
```

**Psychic Shield Math:**

_Damage reduction:_

- Opponent attacks for 60 ‚Üí You take 40
- Opponent attacks for 80 ‚Üí You take 60
- Opponent attacks for 120 ‚Üí You take 100
- Every 20 damage matters (card HP ranges)

_Strategic value:_

- Turns trades into favorable exchanges
- Allows you to stabilize vs aggro
- Gives you time to draw into your late game

**Advanced Tech Lines:**

**Line 1: The Wall (vs aggro)**

- Turn 1: Mewtwo ex (no energy, save for later)
- Turn 2: Mewtwo ex + 1 energy
- Turn 3: Power up + Psychic Shield
- Now you can take 2-3 hits while opponent exposes themselves
- This is how you beat fast decks

**Line 2: The Control (vs midrange)**

- Turn 1: Search pieces (Pok√© Ball)
- Turn 2: Get Mewtwo + energy
- Turn 3: Psychic Shield
- Turn 4+: Trade efficiently, build card advantage
- Force opponent to make first mistake

**Line 3: The Comeback (when behind)**

- Turn 1: Bench defender
- Turn 2: Stay back, draw cards
- Turn 3: Mewtwo ex + power up (sudden presence)
- Psychic Shield stabilizes your position
- Now you're in the game

**Matchup-Specific Sequencing:**

**Vs Charizard:**

- You lose race condition ‚Üí Don't try
- Psychic Shield makes your trades favorable
- Force them to overcommit to multiple Charizards
- Then remove one, leaving them vulnerable

**Vs Blaziken:**

- Similar to Charizard
- Psychic Shield reduces Fire Rush value
- You outlast their fast starts
- Late game: Your shield + multiple threats = win

**Vs Pikachu:**

- Pikachu is fast but fragile
- Psychic Shield helps you survive first hits
- Then you remove them
- You are the tank, they are glass cannon

### Pikachu ex (Circle Circuit) - Perfect Sequencing

**Critical Principles:**

- Requires PERFECT sequencing and energy management
- Multiple Pikachu variants = scalable damage
- High skill ceiling, high reward

**Opening Sequence:**

```
TURN 1 (Going First):
Priority: Any Pikachu with lightning energy = 10/10
This is mandatory for your game plan
Second: No Pikachu but lightning energy = 3/10 (search needed)
Never: No lightning energy = 1/10

TURN 2:
Priority: Attack with Pikachu for 20 damage
This establishes Circle Circuit: subsequent Pikachu get +20 damage
Second Pikachu will hit for 40 damage (20+20)
This scales quickly

TURN 3+:
Goal: Multiple Pikachu variants in play
1st Pikachu: 20 damage
2nd Pikachu: 40 damage
3rd Pikachu: 60 damage
This compounds and becomes lethal

TURN 4:
Priority: Attack with 2nd Pikachu (40 damage)
If opponent can't remove you, you win turn 5 with 60 damage
This is your timing window
```

**Circle Circuit Math:**

_Scaling damage:_

- 1 Pikachu in play: 20 damage
- 2 Pikachu in play: 20 + 40 = 60 damage per turn
- 3 Pikachu in play: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 damage per turn
- This is your win condition

_Critical timing:_

- Turn 2: Establish Circle Circuit
- Turn 3: Add second threat
- Turn 4: Apply pressure
- Turn 5: Close game (if opponent can't respond)

**Advanced Tech Lines:**

**Line 1: The Rush (vs control)**

- Turn 1: Pikachu + lightning
- Turn 2: Attack 20 damage
- Turn 3: Second Pikachu, attack 60 damage total
- Turn 4: Third Pikachu, attack 120 damage total
- This is explosive, but fragile

**Line 2: The Protection (vs aggro)**

- Turn 1: Pikachu + lightning
- Turn 2: Attack 20 damage
- Turn 3: Instead of attacking, add second Pikachu
- Turn 4: Attack with both (60 damage)
- You sacrifice tempo for board security

**Line 3: The Flex (when behind)**

- Turn 1: Any basic with lightning
- Turn 2: Search for Pikachu while attacking 20
- Turn 3: Pikachu enters with Circle Circuit bonus
- Turn 4: Attack for 40
- Still competitive even from behind

**Matchup-Specific Sequencing:**

**Vs Charizard:**

- They have more HP, you have more speed
- You must win before Red Boost activates
- If they get Red Boost before you have 2 Pikachu ‚Üí You lose
- Force them to defend

**Vs Blaziken:**

- Similar speed matchup
- Fire Rush vs Circle Circuit
- Whoever scales first wins
- Don't trade fairly

**Vs Mewtwo:**

- Mewtwo's shield reduces your damage
- You need MORE Pikachu to overcome
- Circle Circuit helps with this
- Keep pressure: can't let them stabilize

### Salamence ex (Bright Wing) - Perfect Sequencing

**Critical Principles:**

- Midrange deck with flexible options
- Strong stats and reasonable energy curve
- No built-in card advantage ‚Üí Play efficiently

**Opening Sequence:**

```
TURN 1 (Going First):
Priority: Dratini/Dragonair with 1 energy = 8/10
Second: Any basic with energy = 6/10
Third: Setup piece (search/draw) = 5/10
Never: Multiple trainers = 2/10

TURN 2:
Priority: Evolve to Salamence ex with 1st energy
Salamence has 90 HP and strong attacks
This is your tempo swing
Second: Add second basic if first is weak

TURN 3:
Priority: Attack with Salamence for 60-70 damage
You should be taking first prize
If opponent has weak Pokemon: KO it
If opponent has strong Pokemon: Trade damage

TURN 4+:
Goal: Maintain pressure with multiple threats
Salamence is good, but not great alone
Add backup attackers
Out-resource opponent through board presence
```

**Bright Wing Value:**

_Stat advantage:_

- Salamence ex has 90 HP (survives most hits)
- Base 60 damage (competitively priced)
- Can scale to 80+ with energy

_Strategic position:_

- Faster than control decks
- Tougher than aggro decks
- Outlast aggro, outpace control

**Advanced Tech Lines:**

**Line 1: The Pressure (vs control)**

- Turn 1: Dratini + energy
- Turn 2: Salamence
- Turn 3: Attack 60 damage, take prize
- Turn 4: Add backup (another Salamence or support)
- Constant pressure, they can't stabilize

**Line 2: The Balance (vs aggro)**

- Turn 1: Any basic
- Turn 2: Salamence with 1 energy
- Turn 3: Attack OR add defender (assess situation)
- Turn 4: Switch between offense and defense as needed
- Flexibility is your strength

**Line 3: The Endgame (when game goes long)**

- Multiple Salamence ex = multiple threats
- Opponent can't remove all at once
- Late-game inevitability through board presence
- Card advantage through superior stats

**Matchup-Specific Sequencing:**

**Vs Charizard:**

- You can trade damage fairly
- Your 90 HP vs their 70 HP = slight advantage
- Force them to Red Boost defensively
- Don't let them stabilize

**Vs Blaziken:**

- Fire Rush vs Bright Wing
- Similar stats, similar pace
- Whoever gets ahead first wins
- Don't waste turns

**Vs Mewtwo:**

- You are faster, they are tankier
- Race them before Psychic Shield stabilizes
- If they get shield online ‚Üí Switch to tempo
- Force inefficient trades

## Endgame Scenarios & Calculations

### Prize Race Mathematics

**Critical Concept:** The player who takes their 3rd prize first wins the game.

**Prize tracking:**

- 0 prizes: Starting position
- 1 prize: First KO, ahead
- 2 prizes: Close to win, opponent vulnerable
- 3 prizes: WIN CONDITION

**Game states to calculate:**

### Scenario Type 1: The Race (Both Players at 1-2 Prizes)

**Setup:**

- You: 1 prize, opponent needs 2 turns to win, you need 2 turns to win
- Opponent: 1 prize, same situation

**Who wins?**

_Turn order matters:_

**If you attack first:**

- Turn 1: You attack, opponent at 2 prizes
- Opponent turn: They attack, you at 2 prizes
- Turn 2: You attack ‚Üí WIN (3rd prize)
- Opponent never gets turn 2 attack

**If opponent attacks first:**

- Opponent turn: They attack ‚Üí WIN
- You never get turn 1 attack

**Rule:** In a perfect race with symmetric damage, **the player who attacks first wins**.

**Decision Tree for Prize Races:**

```
CURRENT SITUATION: Both players have 1-2 prizes, race condition

         |
    [Can you win this turn?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
         |      [If you take 2nd prize and opponent takes 2nd prize: You still win (attack first)]
         |
        NO
         |
    [Can opponent win this turn?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [Can you prevent it?]
         |      [If you can KO their attacker?] ---‚ü∂ BLOCK THEM
         |      [If you can't prevent it?] ---‚ü∂ ATTACK FACE (take prize, force draw)
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ [Set up to win next turn]
                 [Damage race: Calculate who can KO first]
                 [If you need 1 hit, they need 2 ‚Üí BUILD DAMAGE]
                 [If you need 2 hits, they need 1 ‚Üí BLOCK THEM]

    [Calculation Formula:]
    YOUR KOs NEEDED = opponent's total Pokemon HP / your damage per turn
    OPPONENT'S KOs NEEDED = your total Pokemon HP / opponent's damage per turn

    [Rule of Thumb:]
    If YOUR KOs < OPPONENT'S KOs ‚Üí Race (attack face)
    If YOUR KOs > OPPONENT'S KOs ‚Üí Block (prevent their damage)
    If YOUR KOs = OPPONENT'S KOs ‚Üí Attack first advantage
```

### Scenario Type 2: The Comeback (You're Behind on Prizes)

**Situation: You're at 0-2 or 1-2 prizes, must race**

**Can you race?**

_Calculate your closing speed:_

- Your damage per turn
- Opponent's HP total
- Opponent's damage per turn
- Your HP total

**Example:**

- You: 0 prizes, 60 damage on board, 40 damage potential next turn = 100 total
- Opponent: 2 prizes, 50 damage on board, attacks for 60 = 110 total
- Turns to win (you): Need 2 hits (opponent has 110 HP, you do 50-60)
- Turns to win (opponent): Needs 1 hit (you have 60 HP, they do 60)

**Decision: CAN YOU RACE?**

_Rule:_ If opponent needs X hits and you need Y hits:

- If X > Y: You CAN race (you win before they do)
- If X < Y: You CANNOT race (they win first)
- If X = Y: YOU MUST attack first to win

**In this example:**

- Opponent needs 1 hit, you need 2 hits
- You CANNOT race unless you can force them to defend
- Your only option: Block their attacks, survive to build bigger board

**When YOU'RE BEHIND but CAN race:**

**Example:**

- You: 0 prizes, 70 damage on board, can do 50 next turn = 120 total
- Opponent: 2 prizes, 20 damage on board, can do 50 next turn = 70 total
- You need: 2 hits (opponent has 70 HP)
- Opponent needs: 2 hits (you have 70 HP)
- EQUAL SPEED ‚Üí You must attack first

**Play: GO FACE IMMEDIATELY**

- Attack for 50 damage (1st prize)
- Opponent attacks for 50 damage (you at 1 prize)
- You attack for 50 (2nd prize ‚Üí WIN)

**When YOU'RE BEHIND and CANNOT race:**

**Example:**

- You: 0 prizes, 20 damage on board, can do 40 next turn = 60 total
- Opponent: 2 prizes, 50 damage on board, can do 60 next turn = 110 total
- You need: 3 hits (opponent has 110 HP)
- Opponent needs: 1 hit (you have 60 HP)

**Play: SURVIVE AND BUILD**

- Block their attacks (don't let them take 3rd prize)
- Build bigger board (multiple attackers)
- Use search cards to find win conditions
- Hope they make a mistake

### Scenario Type 3: The Standoff (Both Players at 2 Prizes)

**CRITICAL SITUATION:** One more prize ends the game.

**Decision matrix:**

```
BOTH AT 2 PRIZES (Next prize wins)

         |
    [Can you attack this turn?]
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ [Your opponent can win]
         |      [Must force defensive play]
         |      [Switch Pokemon to stall]
         |
        YES
         |
    [Can you win this turn?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ WIN IMMEDIATELY
         |      [Ignore all other considerations]
         |
        NO
         |
    [Can opponent win this turn?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ [Must prevent it]
         |      [Can you KO their attacker?] ---‚ü∂ YES ‚Üí Do it
         |      [Can you switch your Pokemon?] ---‚ü∂ YES ‚Üí Do it
         |      [Neither option?] ---‚ü∂ [Race anyway, hope they miss]
         |
        NO ---‚ü∂ [Build advantage for next turn]
                 [Set up guaranteed win]
                 [Force opponent to make first mistake]
```

**The 2-Prize Standoff Principles:**

1. **NEVER attack their benched Pokemon** (wastes turn)
2. **ALWAYS prioritize preventing their win** (over your own win)
3. **If you can win, DO IT** (no tricks, just victory)
4. **If neither can win, assess next turn** (position for guaranteed win)

### Scenario Type 4: The Bluff (Opponent Knows Your Position)

**Situation:** Both players at 2 prizes. Opponent knows you cannot win this turn.

**Your options:**

**Option 1: The Fake Attack**

- Pretend you can win
- Attack their active Pokemon (not face)
- Force them to spend resources defending
- Next turn: You actually win

**Option 2: The Switch**

- Switch your active Pokemon (waste turn intentionally)
- Force opponent to attack your new Pokemon
- This saves your original Pokemon for future turns

**Option 3: The All-In**

- Attack face for damage (not lethal)
- Force them to respond
- Next turn: You win regardless

**When to use bluffs:**

- When you're behind on resources
- When opponent has played conservatively
- When you can force them to waste a turn

### Endgame KO Calculations

**Critical Formula:**

```
TURNS TO WIN = (Opponent's Total HP) / (Your Damage Per Turn)

Example:
Opponent has Pokemon worth 100 HP total
You do 50 damage per turn
TURNS TO WIN = 100 / 50 = 2 turns
```

**Damage variance considerations:**

_Base damage:_

- 1 energy Pokemon: 20-30 damage (fast, early game)
- 2 energy Pokemon: 50-60 damage (mid game)
- 3+ energy Pokemon: 80-120 damage (late game)

_Attack bonuses:_

- Energy acceleration (Red Boost, Fire Rush): +20-40 damage
- Buffs/abilities: +10-30 damage
- Multiple attackers: Add damage together

**Example calculations:**

**Charizard ex with Red Boost:**

- 2 fire energy: Base 50 + Red Boost 30 = 80 damage
- Turn 1 with Red Boost: 80 damage
- Against 80 HP Pokemon: 1 turn KO
- Against 150 HP Pokemon: 2 turn KO

**Blaziken ex with Fire Rush:**

- 2 energy: Base 60 + Fire Rush 10 = 70 damage
- Against 70 HP Pokemon: 1 turn KO
- Against 140 HP Pokemon: 2 turn KO

**Multiple attackers (Pikachu ex line):**

- 1st Pikachu: 20 damage
- 2nd Pikachu: 40 damage (Circle Circuit bonus)
- Total per turn: 60 damage
- Against 120 HP Pokemon: 2 turn KO

**Opponent damage calculations:**

**You must calculate opponent's damage potential:**

_Turn 1:_

- Usually 0 damage (no energy)

_Turn 2:_

- 1 energy attacker: 20-30 damage
- If they have evolution line: Might have 0-20 damage

_Turn 3:_

- 2 energy attacker: 50-60 damage
- If they rushed evolution: 60-70 damage

_Turn 4+:_

- Full power: 80-120 damage
- Multiple attackers: 100-200 damage

**Race calculations:**

_Your position:_

- Current damage on opponent: 40 damage
- Your attack next turn: 60 damage
- Total after your attack: 100 damage (1st prize)

_Opponent's position:_

- Current damage on you: 30 damage
- Opponent's attack next turn: 70 damage
- Total after opponent attack: 100 damage (1st prize)

**With symmetric damage, who wins?**

- You attack first ‚Üí You take prize first ‚Üí You win
- Opponent attacks first ‚Üí They take prize first ‚Üí They win

**This is why turn order matters in races!**

### Scenario Workbook

**Worked Example 1:**

_Setup:_

- You: 1 prize, Charizard ex with 2 fire energy (can do 80)
- Opponent: 1 prize, Pikachu ex with lightning energy (can do 40)
- Your Charizard has 20 damage
- Opponent's Pikachu has 10 damage

_Your turn:_

- Option A: Attack face for 80 ‚Üí You take 2nd prize (WIN)
- Option B: Attack Pikachu for 80 ‚Üí KO it, take prize, still at 2-1
- Option C: Defend/pass

_Analysis:_

- Option A is CORRECT (take the win)
- Option B is suboptimal (wastes turn on overkill)
- Option C is terrible (they attack next turn and win)

_Correct play: ATTACK FACE (Option A)_

**Worked Example 2:**

_Setup:_

- You: 0 prizes, Blaziken ex with 2 energy (can do 70)
- Opponent: 2 prizes, Salamence ex with 2 energy (can do 60)
- Your Blaziken has 30 damage
- Opponent's Salamence has 50 damage

_Your turn:_

- Option A: Attack face for 70 ‚Üí You take 1st prize (1-2)
- Opponent's turn: They attack for 60 ‚Üí You take 2nd prize (2-2)
- Your next turn: Attack face ‚Üí WIN (3rd prize)

_Analysis:_

- This is a RACE
- You need 2 hits, they need 2 hits
- You attack first ‚Üí YOU WIN

_Correct play: ATTACK FACE (start the race)_

**Worked Example 3:**

_Setup:_

- You: 1 prize, Mewtwo ex with 2 energy (can do 60, Psychic Shield active)
- Opponent: 2 prizes, Charizard ex with 2 fire energy (can do 80)
- Your Mewtwo has 40 damage
- Opponent's Charizard has 20 damage

_Your turn:_

- Option A: Attack face for 60 ‚Üí You take 2nd prize (2-2)
- Opponent's turn: They attack for 80 ‚Üí Psychic Shield reduces to 60 ‚Üí You at 2 prizes
- Next turn: You attack ‚Üí WIN

_Analysis:_

- This is a RACE but you're protected by Psychic Shield
- You will survive their attack
- You attack first ‚Üí YOU WIN

_Correct play: ATTACK FACE (leverage your shield)_

**Worked Example 4:**

_Setup:_

- You: 0 prizes, Pikachu ex (20 damage on board), can play second Pikachu
- Opponent: 2 prizes, Blaziken ex with 2 energy (can do 70)
- Your turn

_Your options:_

- Option A: Attack with first Pikachu (20 damage total)
- Option B: Play second Pikachu, then attack (60 damage total)
- Option C: Attack their benched Pokemon

_Analysis:_

- You need to race but are behind
- Option A: Does only 20, insufficient pressure
- Option B: Does 60, takes 1st prize (1-2), strong pressure
- Option C: Wastes turn on benched Pokemon

_Correct play: OPTION B (play second Pikachu, attack for 60)_

---

## Micro-Decisions & Edge Cases

### Energy Placement Priorities

**Critical decision:** Where to place your energy each turn?

**General priority (from most to least important):**

1. **Active Pokemon that's attacking** (obviously)
2. **Active Pokemon that will attack next turn**
3. **Benched Pokemon that can evolve this turn**
4. **Benched Pokemon with evolution line intact**
5. **Benched Pokemon that provides utility**

**Special case: Multiple attackers**

_Scenario:_ You have Charizard ex (2 energy) attacking, and Charmander on bench that can evolve next turn.

_Question:_ Do you place 3rd energy on Charizard or 1st energy on Charmander?

_Answer:_ It depends on your position.

**If you're ahead:**

- Place energy on Charmander (build for future)
- Charizard can still attack effectively
- You're playing for long game

**If you're behind:**

- Place energy on Charizard (finish them now)
- Don't build for future if there might not be a future
- You're racing, not stabilizing

**If it's turn 3 and you can evolve Charmander:**

- Place energy on Charmander (evolve to Charmeleon, set up Charizard)
- This is a tempo swing
- Next turn: Charizard in play

### Bench Positioning Strategy

**Why bench position matters:**

_Opponent's gust of wind effects can target benched Pokemon_
_Opponent can attack benched Pokemon for 50 damage_
_You want to maximize their options_

**Optimal bench positioning:**

**If opponent has gust effects:**

- Put your weakest Pokemon in position to get hit (Pidgey, weak basics)
- Save your strong Pokemon for positions they're less likely to hit
- Force them to waste damage

**If opponent has area-of-effect attacks:**

- Spread out your threats
- Don't cluster your attackers
- Make them choose which one to hit

**Matchup-specific positioning:**

_Vs Charizard ex (attacks benched Pokemon):_

- Put expendable Pokemon in gust range
- Keep Charizard evolution line protected
- Make them waste turns hitting your bench

_Vs Blaziken (focused single-target):_

- All Pokemon are equally vulnerable
- Focus on getting attackers online, not positioning
- You can't avoid their attacks anyway

_Vs Mewtwo (control, few gusts):_

- Bench position less critical
- Focus on optimal evolution lines
- Don't waste turns on complex positioning

### The Retreat Decision

**When to switch your active Pokemon:**

**ALWAYS retreat if:**

- Your active Pokemon has 0 damage
- Opponent's active Pokemon can KO it this turn
- You have no way to respond (no energy, no switch)
- Switching gives you tempo advantage

**NEVER retreat if:**

- Your active Pokemon has 30+ damage (opponent can't 1HKO)
- Opponent can't capitalize on the switch
- You're building toward a combo

**Situation-based decisions:**

**Scenario 1:** You're at 20 damage on your active, opponent can do 30 next turn.

_If you retreat:_

- Save your Pokemon
- Opponent attacks your new Pokemon
- You take 30 damage anyway

_If you don't retreat:_

- Your Pokemon gets KO'd
- Opponent takes a prize
- You might be at 2-2 or 2-1

_Decision:_ Depends on prizes.

**If you're at 0-2 prizes:** Don't retreat (you can't afford to fall further behind)
**If you're at 1-1 prizes:** Retreat (maintain parity)
**If you're at 2-0 prizes:** Retreat (protect your lead)

### The Search Card Dilemma

**When to use Professor's Research vs. Pok√© Ball:**

**Professor's Research (discard 3, draw 3):**

- Best when you have dead cards in hand
- Worst when you have good cards to keep
- Use to find specific pieces (energy, attackers)
- Can backfire (discard something you need)

**Pok√© Ball (search for Pokemon):**

- Best for finding evolution lines
- Worst when you have no energy in hand
- Guaranteed Pokemon (vs. random draws)
- Safe, predictable

**Decision tree:**

```
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
         |
    Pokemon (evolution line, specific attacker)
         |
        ---‚ü∂ Pok√© Ball (guaranteed search)

    Energy (to power up)
         |
        ---‚ü∂ Pok√© Ball if you have no Pokemon
         |
        ---‚ü∂ Professor's if you have Pokemon but no energy

    Any card (dead hand, no options)
         |
        ---‚ü∂ Professor's Research (chance to find what you need)

    Multiple options (flexible hand)
         |
        ---‚ü∂ Consider: What would happen if you whiff?
         |      [If you can afford to miss] ‚Üí Professor's
         |      [If you NEED something] ‚Üí Pok√© Ball
```

**When NOT to use search cards:**

**Turn 1:** You have decent hand, don't waste turn
**Turn 2:** You might need to attack instead
**Turn 3:** If you can win this turn, don't search
**When opponent is ahead on prizes:** Speed matters more than consistency

### The Threat Assessment

**Every turn, assess threats on board:**

**Opponent's threats:**

- Active Pokemon damage potential
- Benched Pokemon evolution potential
- Their hand size (do they have options?)
- Their energy count (can they power up?)
- Your current Pokemon (can you survive?)

**Your threats:**

- What can you do next turn?
- What can you do turn after next?
- What would happen if opponent removes your current attacker?
- Do you have backup plans?

**Threat matrix:**

```
OPPONENT'S THREATS    YOUR RESPONSE
Low damage, weak bench    Build advantage, maintain tempo
High damage, weak bench    Block/kill their attacker
Low damage, strong bench    Attack their benched threats
High damage, strong bench    Race or find removal
```

### The Bluff

**When to make your opponent think you have something you don't:**

**Classic bluff: Pretend you can win**

_Situation:_ You're at 1 prize, opponent at 2 prizes. They can't win this turn, you can't win this turn. You have weak hand.

_Your play:_ Attack their active Pokemon aggressively (pretend you have big damage)

_Goal:_ Force them to play defensively next turn (switch Pokemon, waste turn)

_Reality:_ You have weak damage, but they don't know that

_Result:_ You buy time to draw into your win condition

**Another bluff: Pretend you're behind**

_Situation:_ You're actually ahead on board, but opponent doesn't know your hand.

_Your play:_ Play passively, pretend you have no good options

_Goal:_ Make them think you're weak, get them to commit

_Reality:_ You have winning line ready

_Result:_ They overcommit, you punish

**When NOT to bluff:**

- When opponent has perfect information (played with you before)
- When you're clearly behind and need every advantage
- When you have actual winning line (don't mess it up)

### The Time Steal

**When to intentionally waste a turn:**

**Situation:** Opponent has winning line next turn, you don't have immediate response.

**Your options:**

1. Try to race (will likely lose)
2. Block them (might work)
3. Waste a turn to delay (changes turn order)

**Example:**

- You: 1 prize, weak Pokemon
- Opponent: 2 prizes, can win next turn
- Your turn

**Strategy: The time steal**

- Play a trainer card (waste your turn intentionally)
- Opponent can't win (you still at 1 prize)
- Opponent wastes turn
- Your next turn: You win

**When this works:**

- Opponent is one turn from victory
- You can't win or block this turn
- You have some action to fill time (switch, trainer, etc.)

**When this fails:**

- Opponent has multiple ways to win
- You have no action to waste time
- They're not actually one turn from winning

### Advanced Math: The Probability Play

**Calculate exact odds of drawing into your win condition:**

**Scenario:** You need 1 specific card to win. You have 3 cards in deck.

**Probabilities:**

- 3 cards left in deck: 33% chance (1 in 3)
- 2 cards left in deck: 50% chance (1 in 2)
- 1 card left in deck: 100% chance

**But you get to draw 3 cards this turn!**

**Revised probability with draw:**

- If you draw 3 cards: 100% chance (you'll see all of them)
- If you draw 2 cards: 67% chance (2 in 3)
- If you draw 1 card: 33% chance (1 in 3)

**Decision: Should you try to draw into it?**

**If you need to win THIS TURN:** Calculate if probability beats opponent's response
**If you can survive next turn:** Higher probability play is better

**Example with 2 cards left:**

- Drawing 2 cards gives you 67% chance
- If you can survive opponent's next attack: Take the gamble
- If you die next turn regardless: Take the gamble (nothing to lose)

**Example with 1 card left:**

- You have 100% chance
- But you need to survive to draw it
- If you can survive: Do it
- If you can't survive: Might as well try

### The Forced Concede

**When to recognize you're dead and move on:**

**Signs you're actually, truly behind:**

1. Opponent needs 1 hit, you need 3+ hits
2. You have no search cards left
3. Opponent has multiple threats
4. You're out of energy sources
5. You're at 2 prizes and behind on tempo

**Signs you still have outs:**

1. You have search cards in deck
2. You have energy in deck
3. You have backup attackers waiting to come online
4. Opponent is low on resources too
5. It's still early game (turn 3-4)

**The concede decision tree:**

```
ARE YOU GOING TO WIN?
         |
        NO (90% certainty) ---‚ü∂ CONCEDE
         |                   [Save time, move to next game]
         |
        MAYBE ---‚ü∂ [Calculate exact outs]
                  [Draw X more cards: Can you win?]
         |
        YES ---‚ü∂ PLAY IT OUT
                 [You might be wrong, but you're not dead yet]

    [When in doubt: PLAY IT OUT]
    [How to tell: List all your outs, count them]
    [If outs < opponent's threats: You lose]
    [If outs >= opponent's threats: You have chance]
```

**Example of clear lose:**

_Your position:_

- 0 prizes, only 1 weak attacker left
- 2 energy in deck, no search cards
- Opponent at 2 prizes, can win next turn

_Opponent's position:_

- Strong attacker, 3 energy
- Multiple threats on bench

_Analysis:_

- You need 2-3 hits to win
- You have 1 weak attacker (maybe 1 hit)
- You need to draw multiple perfect cards
- Opponent can win next turn regardless

**Decision: CONCEDE (no realistic outs)**

**Example of still alive:**

_Your position:_

- 1 prize, decent board
- 5 cards in deck
- 1 Professor's Research left
- 2 energy in deck

_Opponent's position:_

- 1 prize, strong position
- Can KO your attacker next turn
- Will take 2nd prize

_Analysis:_

- You need to survive 1 turn
- Then you get 3 cards (Professor's)
- You might draw into energy + backup attacker
- Even if you draw medium, you have 1-2 turns before losing

**Decision: PLAY IT OUT (reasonable outs exist)**

## Final Strategic Principles

### The Hierarchy of Decisions

**When everything is on the line, in this order:**

1. **Don't lose immediately** (prevent opponent from taking winning prize)
2. **Take the prize if you can** (win if you have the line)
3. **Build toward next turn's winning line** (set up guaranteed win)
4. **Maintain tempo advantage** (keep pressure on opponent)
5. **Card advantage** (draw more cards than opponent)
6. **Board advantage** (have more threats than opponent)

### The 80/20 of Competitive Play

**80% of games are decided by:**

- Proper mulligan decisions
- Turn 2-3 tempo establishment
- Recognizing when to race vs. tempo
- Calculating KO ranges correctly

**20% of games require:**

- Advanced bluffs
- Complex bench positioning
- Probability calculations
- Reading opponent's hand

### The Mental Game

**Professional players know:**

- Every turn has exactly one optimal play
- If you can't find it, you're not looking hard enough
- Confidence comes from practice and calculation
- Your opponent makes mistakes too

**Master tier checklist:**

- ‚úÖ I know my deck's exact damage output at each energy level
- ‚úÖ I can calculate turns to win in under 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ I know my mulligan boundaries (keep/mulligan lines)
- ‚úÖ I recognize opponent's deck archetype by turn 2
- ‚úÖ I have decision trees for all common scenarios
- ‚úÖ I don't make the same mistake twice

**Remember:** In Pokemon TCG Pocket, the player who makes fewer mistakes wins. The player who recognizes game states and responds correctly wins. The player who calculates precise outcomes wins.

Master these principles, practice these scenarios, and you'll climb the competitive ladder.
