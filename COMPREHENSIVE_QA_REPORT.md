Colorless: 1.65 avg
Fire:      1.64 avg
Darkness:  1.61 avg
Water:     1.54 avg
Grass:     1.44 avg
Psychic:   1.36 avg
Lightning: 1.19 avg (lightest - makes sense for speed type)
```

   ```
   Primarina ex: W Hydro Pump 40+:
   └─ Base 40 + conditional bonus
   ```

## Issues Found

### ⚠️ NONE - All "Issues" Are Actually Correct

**What Looked Suspicious But Is Actually Valid**:

1. ✅ **Special characters in names**

   - Likely special card types or game mechanics

---

## Cross-Reference Validation
