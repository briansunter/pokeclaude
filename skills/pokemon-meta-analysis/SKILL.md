### 2. Deck Archetypes (Current Meta)

**Mega Evolution + Stage 2 Combo:**

The dominant archetype in B2/B2a meta. Combines Mega ex power with Stage 2 utility.

- Mega Altaria ex + Greninja (S-tier)
- Mega Absol ex + Greninja (A+ tier)

Combines direct damage with hand/board disruption.

- Mega Absol ex + Hydreigon (S-tier)

Focus on damaging multiple Pokemon to set up KOs.

- Greninja ex + Suicune ex (S-tier)

**Energy Acceleration:**

_Key Strategy:_ Accelerate energy to power up attacks faster than normal curve.

**Immunity/Protection:**

### 4. Matchup Matrix

**Favorable Matchups:**

```
Lightning → Water (Zapdos melts Water Pokemon)
Psychic → Fighting (Mewtwo ex crushes Fighting-types)
Fire → Grass (Charizard burns Grass types)
Water → Fire (Blastoise extinguishes flames)
```

**Difficult Matchups:**

```
Lightning ← Fighting (LucarioSM beats Pikachu)
Psychic ← Darkness (YveltalEX overcomes Mewtwo)
Fire ← Water (Water neutralizes fire strategies)
Colorless ← Anything (No resistances = vulnerable)
```

### 5. Strategic Considerations

**Energy Zone Impact:**

- No energy in deck (unique to Pocket format)
- 1 Energy/turn auto-generation
- Focus on low-energy cost attacks
- 1-2 type decks recommended
- Avoid 3+ energy attackers

**20-Card Format:**

- High consistency required
- Limited bench (3 Pokemon max)
- Every card must have purpose
- No "bricks" (unusable cards)

**Ex Pokemon Rules:**

- Worth 2 points when knocked out
- High reward, high risk
- Attack first or be attacked first
- Bench protection limited

### 6. Current Meta Trends (Fantastical Parade B2 + Paldean Wonders B2a)

**Meta Shift (February 2026):**

The B2 and B2a sets introduced powerful new Pokemon ex and Mega Evolutions that have reshaped the meta:

**Dominant Archetypes:**

| Archetype | Share | Key Cards |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Water/Greninja | 25% | Greninja, Greninja ex, Suicune ex |
| Dragon/Flying | 20% | Mega Altaria ex, various partners |
| Dark/Dragon | 15% | Mega Absol ex, Hydreigon, Darkrai ex |
| Lightning | 12% | Bellibolt ex, CB Magnezone |
| Fire | 10% | Mega Charizard Y ex, Entei ex, Mega Blaziken ex |
| Grass | 8% | Teal Mask Ogerpon ex, Meowscarada ex |
| Other | 10% | Various niche decks |

**Rising Strategies:**

- **Mega Evolution + Stage 2 combos** (Mega Altaria + Greninja)
- **Bench sniping** (Greninja's Water Shuriken, Chien-Pao ex's Diving Icicles)
- **Disruption + Damage** (Mega Absol ex's Darkness Claw discards Supporters)
- **Energy acceleration** (Misty, Baxcalibur's Ice Maker, Volt Charge)
- **Immunity tactics** (Pom-Pom Oricorio's ex immunity)
- **OHKO setups** (Training Area + Gourgeist, Bellibolt ex consistency)

**Declining Strategies:**

- Pure basic Pokemon rush (outpaced by Mega + Stage 2 combos)
- Mono-type without synergy (dual-type decks dominate)
- High-energy attackers (3+ cost) without acceleration
- Decks without bench manipulation options

**New B2a (Paldean Wonders) Impact:**

| Card | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Bellibolt ex | A-tier Lightning attacker, counters Suicune ex |
| Meowscarada ex | Grass aggro option, targets benched Megas |
| Chien-Pao ex | Water sniper with Energy acceleration needs |
| Gholdengo ex | Metal acceleration with Dialga ex |
| Armarouge ex | Fire attacker with Armor Cannon |
| Baxcalibur | Chien-Pao ex partner for Energy acceleration |
