- **Missing types** (for Pokemon): 0  
- **Missing HP** (for Pokemon): 0
- **Missing attacks** (for Pokemon): 0
- **Duplicate cards**: 0

### 2. ✅ Type Parsing Quality

All 11 Pokemon types correctly parsed:
```
Water: 286  |  Grass: 272  |  Colorless: 260  |  Psychic: 236
Fighting: 218  |  Darkness: 165  |  Lightning: 164  |  Fire: 159
Metal: 101  |  Dragon: 29  |  Trainer/Item: 187
```

**Hyphenated names fixed**:
- ✅ Jangmo-o → Dragon (was: "o")
- ✅ Porygon-Z → Colorless (was: "Z")  
- ✅ Ho-Oh ex → Fire (was: "Oh ex")

---

### 3. ✅ Attack Data Quality

**Completeness**: 100% of Pokemon have attacks

**Damage Patterns Verified**:

1. **Normal Attacks** ✅
   ```
   Charizard ex: RCC Slash: 60; RRCC Crimson Storm: 200
   ```

2. **Effect-Only Attacks** (NO damage - this is CORRECT!) ✅
   ```
   Charizard ex: R Stoke: 
   └─ Utility move that attaches energy (no damage)
   
   Moltres ex: R Inferno Dance:
   └─ Energy generation move (no damage)
   ```

3. **Variable Damage** (base + conditional bonus) ✅
   ```
   Primarina ex: W Hydro Pump 40+:
   Blastoise ex: WWC Hydro Bazooka 100+:
   ```

4. **Multiplier Attacks** ✅
   ```
   Pikachu ex: LL Circle Circuit: 30x
   Zapdos ex: LLL Thundering Hurricane: 50x
   ```

**What looked suspicious but is actually correct**:
- Attacks ending with `: ` are effect-only moves (no base damage)
- Attacks with `+:` have variable damage described in effects
- Attacks with `x` do damage multiple times

## Issues Found

### ⚠️ Minor (Acceptable)

**Attack effect descriptions not captured**

Example: Charizard ex "Stoke" shows as `: ` without the effect text.

**Why this is OK**:
- The `card_url` field links to full card details
- Attack damage values ARE captured
- Effect-only attacks are identifiable by the pattern

**Impact**: LOW - Not needed for most use cases (deck building, type filtering, etc.)

## Recommended Usage

### ✅ Perfect For:
- Card database applications
- Deck builders
- Collection trackers  
- Type/meta analysis
- Game balance studies

## Conclusion

**The CSV is PRODUCTION READY** with excellent data quality.

All critical fields are complete, types parse correctly (including hyphenated names), and attack damage is properly captured. The only minor limitation is missing effect text, but this is acceptable given that card URLs provide complete details.

**Confidence Level**: **HIGH** ✅

Use this data with confidence for Pokemon Pocket card applications!
