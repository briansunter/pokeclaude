## ADVANCED DECK TECHNIQUES

### Turn 1: Mulligan Decisions

**ALWAYS Keep**:

- Basic Pokemon of your primary type
- At least one search card (Poké Ball)
- Path to evolution line (basic + stage 1 OR Rare Candy)

**Keep If**:

- Professor's Research (if early game card draw needed)
- Multiple basics (for flexibility)
- Sabrina against fast opponents

**NEVER Keep**:

- Only energy cards (energy zone provides this)
- Late-game Pokemon without setup path
- 3+ trainers with no Pokemon

**Example Optimal Openers**:

- **Charizard ex**: Charmander + Poké Ball + Professor's Research
- **Pikachu ex**: Pikachu + Voltorb + Poké Ball
- **Mewtwo ex**: Abra + Professor's Research + Rare Candy

### Mid-Game: Board Control

**Sabrina Usage**:

- **Turn 2**: Against Rare Candy decks (prevent turn 3 evolution)
- **Turn 3**: Against established threats (disrupt their tempo)
- **Turn 4+**: Remove high-HP threats before they attack
- **When NOT to use**: Don't waste on basic Pokemon or early plays

**Energy Management**:

- Energy zone = 1 energy per turn, automatically
- Don't overspend on energy attachment
- Hold 1-2 energy in reserve for Giovanni activation
- Track opponent's energy zone for damage calculations

**Giovanni Timing**:

- Use when you can achieve a KO
- Save for turn 4+ when damage numbers matter
- Don't waste on early chip damage (use basic attacks)
- Calculate: Base Damage + Giovanni (30) ≥ Opponent HP

### Late-Game: Win Conditions

**Point System**:

- **Ex Pokemon**: 2 points when KO'd
- **Regular Pokemon**: 1 point when KO'd
- **Goal**: First to 3 points wins

**Exploitation Strategies**:

- **Ex Pokemon**: Prioritize these for points (2 for 1 exchange)
- **Multiple threats**: Don't over-commit to one Pokemon
- **Bench damage**: Use attacks that hit benched Pokemon
- **Retreat control**: Use high retreat costs to trap opponents

**Common Win Patterns**:

1. **Aggro Win**: KO 2 ex Pokemon (4 points) + 1 regular (1 point)
2. **Control Win**: 3 regular Pokemon over time
3. **Tempo Win**: Force opponent into bad Sabrina timing

**The "Sabrina Trap"**:

- Let opponent establish their win condition
- Use Sabrina to reset their board
- Attack with your established threats
- This typically happens turns 3-4

## COMMON MISTAKES

### Deck Building Errors

**1. Too Many Energy Cards**

- **Mistake**: Including 4-6 energy in deck
- **Why it's bad**: Waste of card slots, energy zone provides this
- **Fix**: Maximum 2 energy cards, preferably none
- **Exception**: Only for very specific synergies

**2. Over-Evolving Pokemon**

- **Mistake**: Always evolving into stage 2 immediately
- **Why it's bad**: Basic Pokemon can win games (1 point)
- **Fix**: Keep 1-2 basics in play as point threats
- **Balance**: Evolve to pressure, keep basics for points

**3. Insufficient Basic Pokemon**

- **Mistake**: Only 4-5 basic Pokemon in deck
- **Why it's bad**: Inconsistent openings, dead draws
- **Fix**: Minimum 6-8 basic Pokemon
- **Distribution**: 3-4 of primary line, 2-3 support, 1-2 utility

**4. Wrong Trainer Ratio**

- **Mistake**: Too many search cards, not enough draw
- **Fix balance**:
  - 4x Professor's Research (mandatory)
  - 3-4x Poké Ball (search)
  - 2x Sabrina (disruption)
  - 2x Rare Candy (evolution decks)
  - 1-2x tech cards

### Gameplay Errors

**1. Attacking Too Early**

- **Mistake**: Using Charizard's RCC Slash turn 3
- **Why it's bad**: Misses lethal timing on turn 4
- **Fix**: Wait for turn 4 to attach 2nd energy + Crimson Storm
- **Exception**: When opponent is low HP from earlier pressure

**2. Poor Sabrina Timing**

- **Mistake**: Using Sabrina on turn 1-2
- **Why it's bad**: Wastes disruption on minimal investment
- **Fix**: Wait until turn 3-4 when opponent commits resources
- **Target priority**: Rare Candy users > Stage 2s > Established threats

**3. Over-Committing to One Pokemon**

- **Mistake**: All energy on single Charizard ex
- **Why it's bad**: Sabrina removes your entire investment
- **Fix**: Split energy between 2 Pokemon
- **Strategy**: Primary attacker + backup for points

**4. Not Tracking Energy Zone**

- **Mistake**: Forgetting auto-generated energy
- **Why it's bad**: Missed lethal damage calculations
- **Fix**: Track both players' energy zones
- **Common miscalculation**: Giovanni adds 30, energy zone adds 20-30/turn

**5. Ignoring the Point System**

- **Mistake**: Only going for ex Pokemon (2 points)
- **Why it's bad**: Leaves easy points on table
- **Fix**: Use basics for early points, ex for pressure
- **Optimal**: 2 ex (4 points) + 1 basic (1 point) = 5 points total

### Advanced Mistakes

**6. Poor Matchup Mulligans**

- **Not keeping**: Meta-specific tech for known matchups
- **Fix**: Adjust mulligan for expected opponents

**7. Energy Zone Misunderstanding**

- **Thinking**: Manual energy attachment required
- **Reality**: Zone generates 1 energy per turn automatically
- **Implication**: Don't waste cards on energy search

**8. Ignoring Retreat Costs**

- **Mistake**: Not leveraging high retreat costs
- **Blastoise ex**: 3 retreat cost = opponent stuck
- **Use case**: If opponent can't retreat, focus fire

**9. Professor's Research Timing**

- **Mistake**: Using turn 1 without need
- **Better**: Use when hand is clogged or out of resources
- **Optimization**: Save for after Rare Candy plays

**10. Not Adapting to Meta**

- **Fixed decklist**: Never changing tech cards
- **Solution**: Switch Sabrina/Giovanni based on local meta
- **Example**: More aggro = more healing; more control = more disruption

## CONCLUSION

### Current Meta Summary (October 2025)

**S-Tier Dominance**:
Charizard ex maintains its position as the premier choice with the highest play rate and tournament success. Its consistency and flexible game plan make it the default recommendation for most players.

**Emerging Trends**:

- **Pikachu ex** gaining popularity in tournaments
- **Mewtwo ex** rising as direct counter to Charizard popularity
- **Energy Zone** fundamentally changing all deck strategies

**Declining Strategies**:

- Pure basic aggro (outclassed by evolution lines)
- Energy-heavy builds (energy zone makes these obsolete)
- Single-threat strategies (vulnerable to Sabrina)

### Meta Predictions

**Next Set Impact (3 months)**:

- **New Fire-type** likely to challenge Charizard's dominance
- **Darkness/Metal types** may emerge as Psychic counters
- **Trainer power creep** possible but energy zone limits impact

**Adaptation Strategies**:

- Master one S-tier deck before branching out
- Understand your local meta specifically
- Practice against multiple archetypes
- Track card acquisition for flexible builds

### Success Factors

**Deck Mastery Requirements**:

1. **50 games minimum** to understand a deck's lines
2. **Energy zone probability** mastery (automatic generation)
3. **Sabrina timing** optimization for disruption
4. **Giovanni damage math** for lethal calculations
5. **Point system** awareness for win conditions

**Key Metrics to Track**:

- Opening hand consistency (aim for 70%+ good opens)
- Turn 3 evolution rate (critical for Stage 2 decks)
- Sabrina usage efficiency (disruptions per game)
- Energy attachment timing (avoid waste)
- Win condition achievement speed (turn 4-5 ideal)

### Practice Recommendations

**Week 1-2: Deck Selection**

- Play 20 games with Charizard ex
- Focus on basic execution
- Track common mistakes

**Week 3-4: Mastery**

- Play 30 games with chosen deck
- Review losses for misplays
- Optimize tech card choices

**Week 5-6: Meta Adaptation**

- Adjust for local meta
- Consider second archetype
- Practice difficult matchups

**Week 7-8: Tournament Prep**

- Focus on best deck
- Fine-tune list for meta
- Mental game and consistency

### Final Thoughts

The Pokemon TCG Pocket meta rewards:

- **Consistent execution** over complex lines
- **Energy zone understanding** for resource management
- **Sabrina timing** for disruption mastery
- **Adaptabilty** to evolving strategies

**Start Simple**: Begin with Charizard ex for its straightforward path to victory.

**Build Complexity**: Add Pikachu ex for bench management and Mewtwo ex for disruption.

**Master All Five**: Understanding all S-tier decks makes you better at each individual deck.

**Meta Awareness**: Success depends not just on deck strength, but on meta positioning and adaptation.
