## Tournament Preparation

### Pre-Event Preparation (1-2 Weeks Before)

#### Meta Research

**Do this immediately before the tournament**:

- Check latest tier lists and win rates
- Identify top 3-5 most common archetypes
- Find recent tournament results and decklists
- Identify emerging trends and new tech

**Example preparation checklist**:

```
Day -14: Research current meta (check LimitlesstCG.com, forums)
Day -10: Test top 3 archetypes vs. your potential deck
Day -7: Refine your list based on testing
Day -3: Practice against actual players (not just bots)
Day -1: Review matchup notes, get good sleep
```

#### Practice Regimen

**Quality over quantity**:

- Play 20-30 matches against real opponents (not AI)
- Practice against each major archetype 5+ times
- Practice specific difficult scenarios:
  - Playing from behind
  - Closing out games
  - Time pressure situations
  - Disadvantaged matchups

**Practice tools**:

- **Ranked ladders**: Play until you consistently hit top 100
- **Practice partners**: Set up scheduled sessions
- **Recording**: Review your games for mistakes

#### Physical Preparation

**Mindset and logistics**:

- Sleep schedule: Get 8 hours for 5 nights before
- Nutrition: Eat stable meals (avoid sugar crashes)
- Hydration: Bring water bottle
- Equipment: Phone charger, backup device

**Mental preparation**:

- Accept variance: Energy zone luck happens
- Focus on decisions, not outcomes
- Visualize difficult scenarios
- Prepare tilt management strategies

### Day-of Preparation

#### What to Bring

**Essential items**:

- Phone with game installed and updated
- Charger and cable
- Water bottle
- Notebook for match tracking
- Deck list for reference

**Optional but helpful**:

- Timer app for time management
- Metagame notes
- Energy zone probability charts
- Matchup reference cards

#### Energy and Focus

**Morning routine**:

- Eat protein breakfast (keeps energy stable)
- Light exercise or stretching
- Arrive 30 minutes early
- Review key matchup notes

**Energy management**:

- Avoid caffeine (causes crashes and tilt)
- Snack on nuts/fruit (sustained energy)
- Stay hydrated
- Take breaks between rounds

## Deck Selection for Competitive Play

### Tier System for Tournament Selection

#### Tier 1: Consistent Winners

**Characteristics**:

- 55%+ win rate across meta
- Strong into multiple archetypes
- Low variance (not dependent on luck)
- Clear game plan

**When to play Tier 1**:

- If you can execute it perfectly
- In large fields (100+ players)
- At your comfort level

**Examples of Tier 1 concepts**:

- Mono-type aggro (Lightning, Water, Fire)
- Stage 2 acceleration with Rare Candy
- Stall with Potion + healing
- Weakness exploitation deck

#### Tier 2: Strong but Situational

**Characteristics**:

- 50-54% win rate
- Good into Tier 1 but loses to other Tier 2
- Requires metagame reading
- Punishes mistakes

**When to play Tier 2**:

- If meta is favorable (you know what you're facing)
- You're extremely comfortable with it
- Other players are playing Tier 1 variants

#### Tier 3: High-Risk/High-Reward

**Characteristics**:

- Can beat anyone with good draws
- Can lose to anyone with bad draws
- Matchup-dependent
- Requires perfect play

**When to play Tier 3**:

- Never in tournaments (too risky)
- Only for practice or casual events

### Tournament Deck Building Rules

#### 20-Card Constraint Makes Every Slot Critical

**No dead cards**:

- Every card must serve multiple purposes
- Cut all "win-more" cards
- Cut situational tech that doesn't come up often

**Example of bad slots**:

- 2-Copy cards in a 20-card deck (statistically inconsistent)
- Pokemon without attacks (no board impact)
- Trainers without immediate impact

#### Consistency Targets

**Minimums for competitive play**:

- 8-10 Basics (50%+ of deck)
- 4-6 attackers ( Pokemon with solid attacks)
- 2-3 professors (draw power)
- 1-2 healing cards (survival)
- 0-1 disruption cards (Sabrina, if at all)

**Mathematically sound reasoning**:

```
In 20 cards, you need to draw Pokemon consistently
10 Basics = 50% chance to draw one in opening hand
With 8 Basics = 40% chance (too low)
```

### Deck Selection Decision Tree

#### Question 1: What are you comfortable with?

- **A**: You have 50+ games with this deck → Continue
- **B**: You have 20-49 games → Practice more
- **C**: You have <20 games → Don't play in tournament

#### Question 2: What's the expected meta?

- **A**: 50%+ of field is Tier 1 Aggro → Pick Control
- **B**: 50%+ of field is Control → Pick Aggro
- **C**: Balanced meta → Pick your strongest, most consistent deck

#### Question 3: What are your results?

- **A**: 60%+ win rate in practice → Good choice
- **B**: 50-59% win rate → Borderline, need improvement
- **C**: <50% win rate → Pick different deck

## Sideboard Theory and Tech Choices

### Understanding Sideboard (Post-Match Tech Swaps)

**Note**: Pokemon TCG Pocket has 20-card decks with no traditional sideboard between games in a match. However, sideboard theory still applies to:

- Tournament day deck selection
- Switching decks between rounds
- Adapting strategy based on opponent's deck

### Pre-Match Deck Selection

#### The 3-Deck Strategy

**Bring 3 decks for tournament**:

- **Deck A**: Your strongest (play this 70% of rounds)
- **Deck B**: Counter to the meta (play when favorable)
- **Deck C**: Experimental or backup (rarely play)

#### Deck Selection Algorithm

```
Round 1: Always start with Deck A (unknown meta)
Rounds 2-4: Switch to Deck B if you saw unfavorable matchups
Round 5+: Stay with best-performing deck

If you lose with Deck A twice → Consider Deck B
If meta is clear and favorable → Commit to Deck B
If you're 4-0 or 5-0 → Don't change winning deck
```

### Matchup-Based Strategy Adjustments

#### Sabrina as "Sideboard Tech"

**Strategic Sabrina usage**:

- **Against ex-heavy decks**: Sabrina forces ex to bench (2 points → 1 point)
- **Against aggro**: Sabrina removes their early pressure
- **Against control**: Sabrina breaks their stalling

**When NOT to Sabrina**:

- Against mirror match (they have Sabrina too)
- When behind in points (need to race)
- When you can win without it

#### Professor Oak as "Sideboard"

**Situation-dependent choice**:

- **Professor's Research**: Use when you need specific cards
- **Professor Oak**: Use when you need multiple options or are behind

**Example decision tree**:

```
Your hand: 3 trainers, 0 Pokemon, 0 energy
Opponent's board: 2 Pokemon, 1 on bench
Decision: Professor Oak (need Pokemon)
Result: Likely to find Basics + energy

Your hand: 2 Basics, 1 Pokemon Communication, 1 energy
Decision: Save Professors, use Communication
Result: Find specific Pokemon you need
```

### Energy Type Adaptation

#### Mono-Type vs. Dual-Type Decision

**Mono-type advantages**:

- 100% energy consistency
- Built-in synergies
- Weakness exploitation
- Predictable damage output

**Dual-type advantages**:

- Flexible attacks
- Can exploit multiple weaknesses
- Harder for opponents to prepare

**Tournament choice**:

- **Meta unknown**: Mono-type (more consistent)
- **Meta known to be weakness-resistant**: Dual-type
- **Your comfort level high**: Choose based on strength, not complexity

### Tech Card Calculations

#### 1-Copy vs. 2-Copy Slots

**Statistically**:

- 1 copy in 20 cards = 5% chance to draw
- 2 copies in 20 cards = 10% chance to draw

**Decision**:

```
Card value: High impact (e.g., Professor Oak)
Your deck space: Limited
1 copy = 5% chance (might not draw it)
2 copies = 10% chance (better, but uses 2 slots)

Example: If you have room, 2 copies is 2x more likely to draw
If space is tight, 1 copy might be enough
```

#### Healing Efficiency

**Potion vs. Multiple Pokemon**:

- Potion: Heals 1 Pokemon for 30 damage
- Alternative: Play additional Pokemon instead

**Math**:

```
With 20 cards:
Option A: 1 Potion + 9 Basics
Option B: 0 Potion + 10 Basics

When you need healing: Option A wins
When you need attackers: Option B wins

Tournament decision: Aggressive meta → Option B (more attackers)
Slow meta → Option A (healing matters more)
```

## Time Management in Competitive Matches

### Pokemon TCG Pocket Time Limits

**Typical tournament rounds**: 15-20 minutes
**Time pressure scenarios**:

- Turn 5+ games going long
- Both players at 2 points (race to finish)
- Multiple decision points in a turn

### Turn-Based Time Management

#### Early Turns (1-2)

**Time budget**: 15-20 seconds

- Quick decisions: play Pokemon, energy, attack
- Don't overthink obvious plays
- Build muscle memory for common actions

**Time-saving habits**:

- Pre-plan during opponent's turn
- Keep hand organized
- Know your deck list by heart
- Have energy types memorized

#### Mid-Game (3-4)

**Time budget**: 30-45 seconds

- Consider Sabrina timing
- Calculate KO math
- Evaluate trade-offs

**Key decisions**:

- Whether to use professor
- Whether to heal or attack
- Whether to Sabrina or save it
- Energy allocation

**Time management technique**:

```
At 30 seconds remaining:
1. Make your best guess
2. Commit to decision
3. Don't overthink
```

#### Late Game (5+)

**Time budget**: 1-2 minutes (race time)

- Both players racing to finish
- Seconds matter for calculations
- Must make quick but accurate decisions

**Racing scenarios**:

```
You have 2 points, opponent has 2 points
Time remaining: 3 minutes

Your options:
1. Attack for 1 point (direct path)
2. Sabrina + attack (force them behind)

Decision time: 15 seconds
If you calculate incorrectly, you lose
```

### Between-Round Time Management

#### Round Schedule

**Typical flow**:

```
Round 1: 20 minutes
5 minute break
Round 2: 20 minutes
10 minute break
Round 3: 20 minutes
Lunch break (30+ minutes)
Round 4: 20 minutes
...
```

#### Break Time Usage

**Active rest**:

- Hydrate immediately
- Light snack if hungry
- Review notes from last round
- Don't over-analyze (causes tilt)

**Mental reset**:

- Clear your head
- Focus on next matchup
- Prepare mentally
- Stay loose and confident

#### Between-Game Tech Adjustments

**Best-of-3 format (if applicable)**:

```
Game 1: Learn their deck
Game 2: Adjust strategy
Game 3: Execute refined plan

Between games: 2 minutes
1 minute: Observe their play style
30 seconds: Decide tech adjustments
30 seconds: Set up for next game

Example adjustments:
- Save Sabrina if they play defensively
- Play aggressively if they drew poorly
- Hold Giovanni if they have high-HP Pokemon
```

### Tournament Day Time Budget

#### Full Day Schedule

**Energy management**:

```
9:00 AM - Arrive, warm up (15 minutes)
9:30 AM - Round 1 (20 minutes)
10:00 AM - Break (5 minutes)
10:15 AM - Round 2 (20 minutes)
10:45 AM - Break (10 minutes)
11:05 AM - Round 3 (20 minutes)
11:35 AM - Lunch (30 minutes)
12:15 PM - Round 4 (20 minutes)
... continue pattern
```

**Avoid fatigue**:

- Conserve mental energy early
- Make fast decisions when safe
- Save focus for crucial rounds
- Stay hydrated but don't drink too much

## Metagame Calls and Adaptation

### Understanding the Meta

#### Meta Definition

**The metagame is the current tournament environment**:

- What decks are being played
- What strategies are successful
- What tech choices are emerging
- What players expect

**Metagame changes**:

- Weekly (as new cards are released)
- Tournament-specific (local meta)
- Seasonal (tier list shifts)

### Pre-Tournament Meta Calls

#### Predicting the Field

**Research methods**:

- Check recent tournament results
- Look at top player decks
- Analyze tier list changes
- Consider local scene preferences

**Common archetypes to prepare for**:

1. **Mono-Lightning** (most common aggro)
2. **Water Ramp** (strong late game)
3. **Stage 2 Beatdown** (consistent power)
4. **Stall/Control** (counters aggro)
5. **Your deck's bad matchup** (must prepare for)

#### Meta Percentage Estimates

**Typical tournament distribution**:

```
50% Tier 1 decks (Lightning, Water, Fire aggro)
30% Tier 2 decks (mixed archetypes)
15% Tier 3 decks (experimental)
5% Strong homebrew
```

**Prepare for the majority**:

- If 50% of field is aggro → Build control elements
- If 30% of field is mirror match → Tech for mirrors
- If 20% is stall → Include anti-stall

### Mid-Tournament Adaptation

#### Information Gathering

**In between rounds**:

- Watch other matches (if possible)
- Ask about common matchups
- Track what decks are winning
- Note tech choices others are using

**From your own matches**:

- What deck gave you trouble?
- What decisions were hardest?
- What would you change?

#### Round 1: Gather Information

**Goals**:

- Learn opponent's deck
- Identify any new tech
- Note play patterns
- Assess your chances

**Don't over-adjust**:

- 1 match = small sample size
- Stick with your strategy
- Make mental notes only

#### Round 2-3: Spot Patterns

**Look for trends**:

- Are control decks performing well?
- Is aggro struggling?
- Are players teching for mirrors?

**Minor adjustments**:

- If you faced 3 aggro decks → Consider healing
- If you faced 3 control decks → Consider speed
- If you faced 3 mirrors → Consider disruption

#### Round 4+: Commit to Strategy

**Trust your preparation**:

- Don't overreact to small samples
- Stick with what you know
- Make only crucial adjustments

**Example**:

```
You planned for 60% aggro, faced 80% aggro → Healing was correct
You planned for 60% aggro, faced 40% aggro → Still stick with plan
Don't switch strategies mid-tournament based on small sample
```

### Reading Opponent's Deck Mid-Match

#### Turn 1-2: Initial Impression

**Clues**:

- What Pokemon did they play?
- Do they have energy or trainers?
- Are they going fast or slow?

**Likely archetype**:

- Early attacker → Aggro
- Defensive setup → Control/Midrange
- Multiple evolutions → Combo/Tempo

#### Turn 3-4: Confirm Pattern

**Key observations**:

- Energy type (mono vs dual)
- Trainer usage (professors, healing)
- Sabrina timing

**Adjust your strategy**:

- They use Sabrina early → Don't over-bench
- They don't attack → Likely control, play aggressively
- They heal a lot → Plan for long game

#### Late Game: Predict Next Move

**What to expect**:

- Professor Oak saved → Big draw coming
- Sabrina saved → Your threat in danger
- No healing left → They're desperate

**Counter their plan**:

- They have Oak → Play around disruption
- They have Sabrina → Keep threats on bench
- No healing → Force them to trade

## Prize Considerations and Risk Management

### Understanding Tournament Structure

#### Swiss Rounds

**How Swiss works**:

- Everyone plays every round
- Win = 3 points, Loss = 0 points
- Top 8 (or cut) based on points
- Tiebreakers matter

**Prize distribution**:

```
1st place: 50% of prize pool
2nd place: 25% of prize pool
3rd-4th: 12.5% each (25% total)
5th-8th: 6.25% each (25% total)
```

**Risk/reward**:

- 5th-8th pays your entry fee
- 3rd-4th doubles your money
- Top 2 is significant prize

#### Strategic Prize Considerations

**If you're 4-0**:

- You can lose 1 round and still make top 8
- Risk playing more aggressively
- Don't over-conservative (protecting lead)

**If you're 3-1**:

- Need 1 more win to secure top 8
- Can afford 1 loss in last 2 rounds
- Calculate tiebreakers if needed

**If you're 2-2**:

- Must win out to make top 8
- No room for error
- Play aggressively

### Risk vs. Reward Matrix

#### High-Risk Plays

**Definition**: Plays that can win big or lose big

```
Examples:
- Sabrina their ex when behind on points
- Professor Oak when you have 3 cards
- Attacking into unknown instead of healing

When to use:
- You need to win to make top 8
- Your back is against the wall
- You have good information opponent can't disrupt you
```

#### Low-Risk Plays

**Definition**: Plays that are safe but give less advantage

```
Examples:
- Healing when you have life
- Playing conservatively when ahead
- Setting up rather than attacking

When to use:
- You're ahead on points
- You can afford to play safe
- Tournament pressure is high (top 8)
```

#### Tournament-Specific Risk Calculation

**Calculate based on**:

- Current record
- Points needed
- Tiebreaker implications
- Opponent's deck strength

**Example scenario**:

```
5th round, you're 3-1
Opponent is also 3-1

Your options:
A. Play aggressively, can win 70%, lose 30%
B. Play conservatively, can win 55%, lose 45%

Analysis:
If you win → 4-1, nearly locked for top 8
If you lose → 3-2, might still make top 8
If you lose conservatively → 3-2, better tiebreakers

Decision: If you're the better player, take aggressive line
Decision: If opponent is stronger, take conservative line
```

### Advanced Prize Thinking

#### Bubble Situations (Making Top 8)

**Calculation**:

```
You need: 6 points (two wins)
Opponents: Strength matters for tiebreakers
Outcome: Two wins almost certainly makes top 8

Your plays:
Round 5: Play to win (must have 6 points)
Round 6: Win and in (if you won round 5)
Round 6: Calculate tiebreakers if you lost round 5
```

**Tiebreaker management**:

```
If you're 3-2, Round 6 matters:
- Beat strong opponent → Good tiebreakers
- Beat weak opponent → Poor tiebreakers
- If multiple people at 3-3, tiebreakers decide

Strategy: In Round 6, prefer stronger opponents
```

#### Top 8 Pressure

**Why it changes**:

- Everyone is equally skilled
- Variance matters more
- Tilt becomes real
- Money is on the line

**Adjusted strategy**:

- Play safer (avoid unnecessary risks)
- Calculate everything twice
- Trust your preparation
- Don't force plays

#### Final Table (Top 4)

**Pure skill at this point**:

- Everyone is excellent
- Meta knowledge is shared
- Variance decides many games
- Mental game is crucial

**Mindset**:

- Accept variance exists
- Focus on your decisions
- Don't tilt on bad beats
- Play your best, results follow

## High-Pressure Decision Making

### Understanding Pressure in Tournaments

#### Types of Tournament Pressure

**Time pressure**: Limited time to decide
**Score pressure**: Need to win to advance
**Prize pressure**: Money on the line
**Audience pressure**: Others watching

**Combined pressure**:

```
Top 8 final table:
Time: 20 minutes for match
Score: Winner goes to finals
Prize: 50% more money
Audience: Streamed, 100s watching

This is extreme pressure
Your decisions must be automatic
```

### Pre-Playing Under Pressure

#### Develop Automatic Responses

**Common scenarios with pre-planned responses**:

```
Scenario: Opponent Sabrina your attacker
Your response: Attack their ex with +10 damage
Automatic (don't think): Use Giovanni, calculate KO

Scenario: You have 2 points, opponent has 2
Your response: Attack immediately
Automatic (don't think): Don't heal, don't stall

Scenario: Turn 2, you have no Pokemon
Your response: Professor Oak immediately
Automatic (don't think): Don't hold it, you need basics
```

**How to develop**:

- Practice these scenarios 50+ times
- Write down your standard response
- Use it under pressure (don't second-guess)
- Only deviate if information suggests otherwise

#### Decision Trees Under Pressure

**Create if-then responses**:

```
If (I have 0 Pokemon in play) → Use Professor Oak
If (I can KO their ex this turn) → Do it
If (I have 2 points and they have 2) → Attack, don't heal
If (I'm behind on points) → Use all resources
If (I'm ahead on points) → Play conservatively
```

**Benefits**:

- Reduces decision time
- Prevents overthinking
- Consistent play under pressure
- Prevents tilt

### Managing Tilt

#### What is Tilt?

**Tilt is emotional frustration affecting decisions**:

- Energy zone luck not going your way
- Making a mistake in crucial moment
- Opponent getting lucky
- Pressures of tournament

**Symptoms**:

- Making rushed decisions
- Playing differently than normal
- Second-guessing good plays
- Giving up on games

#### Tilt Prevention

**Before tournament**:

- Accept variance exists
- Visualize bad beats happening
- Prepare mental reset techniques
- Sleep well, eat well

**During tournament**:

- Between-round breaks: reset mentally
- Stay hydrated, avoid caffeine
- Don't over-analyze bad luck
- Focus on next decision, not past mistakes

**Example**:

```
Bad beat: Energy zone gave you Water 3 times, you need Lightning
Tilt reaction: "This game is unwinnable, why even try?"
Correct response: "Energy luck happens, make the best of it"
Focus: What can you do with Water energy?
```

#### Tilt Recovery Techniques

**If you feel tilt coming**:

1. **Stop**: Take 3 deep breaths
2. **Reset**: Clear your mind of frustration
3. **Focus**: What is the next best play?
4. **Execute**: Make that play confidently

**Example recovery**:

```
You just made a mistake that cost you a point
Feeling frustrated and tilted

Technique:
1. Stop thinking about the mistake
2. Say "Next play" out loud (if allowed)
3. Focus on current game state
4. Make the best available play
5. Move on, don't carry emotion
```

### Information Processing Under Pressure

#### Critical vs. Non-Critical Information

**Critical information** (must gather):

- Current point score (you vs. them)
- Your hand and board state
- Opponent's visible resources
- Time remaining

**Non-critical information** (can ignore):

- What they might have in hand
- Their exact deck list
- Past games/previous rounds
- Other matches happening

**Focus technique**:

```
Under pressure, your brain wants to think about everything
Force yourself to focus ONLY on:
1. What I can see
2. What I need to decide
3. My available options

Everything else is noise
```

#### Decision Simplification

**Complex decisions under pressure**:

```
Scenario: 6 different lines of play available
You have 15 seconds to decide

Don't try to evaluate all 6
Instead:
1. Identify 2 best options
2. Compare those 2
3. Pick one and commit

Example:
Option A: Sabrina + attack (60% win)
Option B: Heal + setup (40% win)
Option C: Aggressive attack (30% win)

Decision: Choose between A and B
```

### Mental Game Tools

#### Confidence Building

**Before tournament**:

- Review your practice wins
- Remember your best games
- Trust your preparation
- Visualize success

**During tournament**:

- After good plays, acknowledge them
- Stay positive between decisions
- Trust your first instincts
- Don't listen to spectators

#### Focus Techniques

**Between turns**:

1. Clear your mind
2. Focus on next decision only
3. Ignore outside noise
4. Execute your plan

**Example mantra**:

```
"Tournament pressure is normal"
"Energy luck happens"
"Make the best decision you can"
"Results will follow good decisions"
```

#### Controlling Breathing

**When stressed or tilted**:

```
4-7-8 breathing technique:
Inhale: 4 counts
Hold: 7 counts
Exhale: 8 counts

Do this 3-4 times
Calms your nervous system
Helps you think clearly
```

## Tournament-Specific Rules and Nuances

### Official Pokemon TCG Pocket Rules

- Professors: Discard hand, draw new cards
- Sabrina: Switch opponent's Active Pokemon
- Giovanni: +10 damage to all attacks (this turn)
- Cyrus: Switch Active Pokemon, do 20 damage
- Potion: Heal 30 damage
- Pokeball: Search deck for Pokemon

**Timing rules**:

- Trainers can be played on opponent's turn (Potion, healing)
- Trainers are 1-time use
- Some trainers can enable KOs (Giovanni)
- Sabrina can be used defensively or offensively

### Competitive Tournament Procedures

#### Match Structure

**Best-of-3 matches** (if applicable):

```
Game 1: Determine decks and strategies
Game 2: Adjust based on what you learned
Game 3: Execute refined plan

Between games: 2-3 minutes
- Share sideboard adjustments (if applicable)
- Reset game state
- Prepare mentally

Match ends when:
- One player wins 2 games
- Time limit is called (convert current game)
```

**Time management**:

- 20 minutes per match
- 5-minute timer starts when called
- Player with most points wins
- Tie = draw, both get 1 point

#### Deck List Submission

**Required at most tournaments**:

- Write down your 20 cards
- Include card counts
- Verify it's within rules

**Why it matters**:

- Prevents illegal decks
- Helps with tiebreakers
- Reference for disputes
- Ensures consistency

#### Starting the Match

**Coin flip or rock-paper-scissors**:

- Winner decides who goes first
- Going first has slight advantage
- Some players prefer second (see their hand)

**First player restrictions**:

- Cannot draw card on Turn 1
- Cannot get energy on Turn 1
- Can play Pokemon and attack Turn 2

**Second player advantages**:

- Sees first player's play
- Can respond to threats
- Has energy on Turn 1 (if they win coin flip for second)

### Rule Enforcement and Disputes

#### Common Rule Questions

**Q: Can I play energy on Turn 1?**
A: No. Turn 1 has no energy phase.

**Q: Can I Sabrina before they play any Pokemon?**
A: Yes, but there's nothing to switch. Waste of a card.

**Q: Does Giovanni apply to all attacks this turn?**
A: Yes, applies to all your Pokemon's attacks this turn.

**Q: Can I heal a Pokemon with 0 damage?**
A: Yes, but it's wasted (Potion heals 30, does nothing if no damage).

#### Calling a Judge

**When to call judge**:

- Unsure about a rule
- Opponent breaking a rule
- Disagreement about game state
- Time call confusion

**How to call judge**:

- Raise your hand
- Ask question clearly
- Both players must pause
- Accept judge's decision

**Important**:

- Judge's ruling is final
- Don't argue with judge
- If you don't understand, ask for clarification
- Be respectful

#### Ruling Examples

**Common disputes**:

```
Scenario: Opponent has 2 ex Pokemon on bench
Question: Can I Sabrina and force them both to Active?
Answer: No, Sabrina targets 1 Pokemon at a time

Scenario: Giovanni + weakness = 40 damage boost?
Answer: No, Giovanni is +10, weakness is +30, total +40

Scenario: Can I retreat a Pokemon with 0 energy?
Answer: Yes, retreat cost is separate from attack cost
```

### Advanced Tournament Nuances

#### Bench Management

**Bench slots matter**:

- Maximum 3 Pokemon on bench
- Sabrina can force Pokemon onto full bench (not allowed)
- Plan bench slots carefully

**Bench strategy**:

```
Don't bench weak Pokemon (1-2 HP)
Don't bench Pokemon without attacks
Do bench Pokemon that can attack
Plan for Sabrina scenarios
```

#### Energy Zone Manipulation

**Understanding randomness**:

- Energy zone is truly random
- Each turn, 1 random energy appears
- You cannot control or predict it
- Opponent sees what energy you get

**Playing around it**:

- Have flexible attackers (different energy costs)
- Keep low-retreat Pokemon for switching
- Don't overcommit to single energy type

**Opponent reads**:

- They see your energy each turn
- If you keep getting wrong energy, they can play aggressively
- If you keep getting right energy, they should be more defensive

#### Professor Oak Timing

**Professor Oak is a powerful card** (draw 3):

- Use when you have many cards (dumping hand)
- Use when you need specific cards immediately
- Use when you're far behind
- Don't use when you have good hand

**Professor's Research** (draw 2):

- More conservative option
- Use when you need specific cards
- Use early for cycling
- Use when Oak isn't necessary

**Interaction with deck**:

```
If you're at 5 cards and opponent has Oak:
- They might refill their entire hand
- You need to apply pressure
- They have many options coming
```
