# Pokemon TCG Pocket: Complete Rules Guide

## Overview

Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is a streamlined version of the Pokemon TCG designed for mobile play. This guide covers all core rules, gameplay mechanics, and how to play.

## Core Game Format

### Deck Construction

- **Deck Size**: Exactly 20 cards (unlike standard TCG's 60 cards)
- **Maximum Copies**: 2 copies per card (no 4-of rule)
- **Minimum Basics**: 5 Basic Pokemon required
- **Recommended Basics**: 6+ Basic Pokemon for consistency

### Card Ratios (Recommended)

- **Pokemon**: 12-15 cards
- **Trainers**: 5-8 cards
- **Energy**: 0 cards (generated by Energy Zone)

## Gameplay Rules

### Turn Structure

#### Turn 1 Restrictions

- **No draw** at the start of Turn 1
- **No energy placement** from Energy Zone
- **No attacks** allowed
- You can only play Pokemon, trainers, and retreat

#### Subsequent Turns

1. **Draw a card** from deck
2. **Place 1 energy** from Energy Zone onto a Pokemon (automatic)
3. **Play Pokemon, trainers** as desired
4. **Attack** (if conditions met)
5. **End turn**

### Energy Zone System

The Energy Zone is a unique mechanic in Pokemon TCG Pocket:

- **Auto-generates**: 1 Energy per turn (starting Turn 2)
- **NOT from deck**: Energy doesn't take up deck slots
- **Random types**: Energy type is random each turn
- **Energy consistency rules**:
  - **1 Energy Type**: 100% consistent (always generates the same type)
  - **2 Energy Types**: 50/50 random split (recommended)
  - **3 Energy Types**: 33/33/33 random split (too inconsistent - AVOID)

### Win Conditions

#### Points System

- **Total Points to Win**: 3 points
- **Regular Pokemon**: 1 point each when Knocked Out
- **ex Pokemon**: 2 points each when Knocked Out

**Example Win Scenarios**:

- Knock out 3 regular Pokemon
- Knock out 1 ex Pokemon + 1 regular Pokemon
- Knock out 2 ex Pokemon

### Bench Rules

- **Maximum Bench Slots**: 3 Pokemon (not 5 like standard TCG)
- **Bench sitters** are vulnerable to:
  - **Sabrina**: Forces opponent to switch their Active Pokemon
  - **Cyrus**: Switches opponent's Pokemon and does damage

### Evolution Rules

- **Stage 2 Decks**: Use **Rare Candy** to skip Stage 1 (crucial!)
- **Evolution Acceleration**: Pokemon Communication for searching evolutions
- **Timing**: Can evolve once per turn (after attacking)

## Card Types

### Pokemon Cards

## Key Strategic Concepts

### Tempo

- Control the pace of the game
- Knock out weak Pokemon early
- Build advantage through efficient attacks

### Card Advantage

- Draw power is crucial
- Professor's Research and Professor Oak are essential
- Don't waste cards unnecessarily

### Energy Management

- The Energy Zone is random - build for consistency
- Use 1-2 energy types maximum
- Plan attacks around energy requirements

### Bench Management

- Only 3 bench slots - use wisely
- Avoid over-benching (vulnerable to Sabrina/Cyrus)
- Keep important Pokemon safe

### KO Math

- Calculate exact damage needed for knockouts
- Account for Giovanni's +10 damage
- Consider weakness and resistance
- Know when to go for the KO vs. building up

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Running 3 Energy Types**
   - Too inconsistent with random generation
   - Stick to 1-2 types maximum

2. **Not Enough Basic Pokemon**
   - Minimum 5, recommended 6+
   - Brick hands lose games

3. **Over-Benching**
   - Leaves Pokemon vulnerable
   - Sabrina and Cyrus punish over-benching

4. **Forgetting Giovanni's +10 Damage**
   - This often changes KO calculations
   - Always factor it into your planning

5. **Skipping Rare Candy in Stage 2 Decks**
   - Rare Candy is essential for efficiency
   - Skipping Stage 1 saves turns

6. **Not Managing Bench Slots**
   - Only 3 slots available
   - Make each bench position count

7. **Poor Energy Planning**
   - Energy Zone is random
   - Build decks that work with 1-2 types

8. **Ignoring Point Values**
   - ex Pokemon are worth 2 points
   - Prioritize knocking out high-value targets

## Advanced Concepts

### Reading Opponents

- Track what's in their hand (hint: they drew 1 card this turn)
- Predict their next move based on available cards
- Force them into difficult decisions

### Timing Attacks

- Sometimes it's better to wait for energy than attack immediately
- Set up big attacks rather than chip damage
- Don't overextend

### Bench Positioning

- Your bench is protected from direct attacks
- Use it to store important Pokemon
- Don't clutter it with throwaway Pokemon

### Trainer Timing

- Use Professor's Research early to cycle through deck
- Save Professor Oak for when you need cards
- Sabrina can win games by disrupting opponents

## Scoring and Victory

To win, you need 3 points:

- 3 regular Pokemon KO'd (3 x 1 point)
- 1 ex + 1 regular Pokemon (2 + 1 points)
- 2 ex Pokemon (2 + 2 points)

The game often ends in 5-7 turns, making every decision critical.

## Sample Turn (Turn 2+)

**Start of Turn**: Draw a card
**Energy Zone**: Auto-generates 1 random energy
**Your Turn**:

1. Place energy on Pokemon (if desired)
2. Play Pokemon from hand
3. Play trainers (if needed)
4. Attack with Active Pokemon
5. End turn

**Opponent's Response**: During your attack phase, they can play trainers in response.
