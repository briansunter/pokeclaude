## Project Context

### PokeClaude Project Overview

This project is a **Pokemon TCG MCP Server** with an auto-updating data scraper:

- **2077+ cards** in database (1068 unique cards after deduplication)
- **DuckDB-powered** card database for fast queries
- **7 MCP tools** for AI-powered deck building:
  - search_cards, get_card, find_synergies, find_counters
  - get_type_stats, query_cards, analyze_deck
- **3 resources** and **3 prompts** for Claude Desktop integration
- Auto-scrapes limitlesstcg.com for new card data

### Key Game Rules Discovered

**Pokemon TCG Pocket Format** (unique from standard TCG):

- **Deck Size**: 20 cards (not 60)
- **Win Condition**: 3 points total
  - ex Pokemon = 2 points
  - Regular Pokemon = 1 point
- **Bench Slots**: Maximum 3 (not 5)
- **Energy Zone**: Auto-generates 1 energy/turn (NOT from deck!)
- **Turn 1 Restrictions**: No draw, no energy, no attack
- **Max Copies**: 2 copies per card
- **Energy Consistency**: 1 type = 100%, 2 types = 50/50, 3+ types = inconsistent
- **Min Basics**: Must have at least 5 basic Pokemon

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### Task Tool Failures

**Attempts**: 2 parallel research task launches
**Outcome**: System-level configuration errors

1. **First Failure**:
   - Error: "invalid params, function name or parameters is empty (2013)"
   - Cause: Parameter validation issue in Task tool

2. **Second Failure**:
   - Error: "Invalid model name passed in model=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"
   - Cause: Model configuration mismatch

**User Question**: "What error with task tool?"
**Answer Provided**: Explained that errors were system-level configuration issues, not user errors

**Impact**: Had to pivot to manual research approach using existing codebase information
