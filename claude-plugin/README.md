# Pokemon TCG Pocket Claude Plugin

A comprehensive Claude Code plugin for Pokemon TCG Pocket featuring deck building, card analysis, meta insights, and AI-powered competitive strategy guidance.

## Overview

This plugin integrates the Pokemon Pocket MCP server to provide access to 2,000+ Pokemon cards across 12 sets, enabling advanced deck building and analysis workflows directly in Claude Code.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Core Capabilities

- **Deck Building**: AI-powered deck construction with synergy analysis
- **Card Analysis**: Detailed stats, competitive ratings, and strategic value
- **Meta Insights**: Current tier lists, usage statistics, and strategic recommendations
- **Counter Strategies**: Find counters to specific Pokemon, types, and deck archetypes

### ðŸ“Š Database Coverage

- **2,077 total cards** across all sets (A1-A4b, P-A)
- **1,068 unique cards** (auto-deduplicated art variants)
- **12 complete sets** from Genetic Apex to Shining Revelry
- **All rarities** from Common to Secret Rare

### ðŸŽ® Pokemon TCG Pocket Integration

This plugin is specifically designed for **Pokemon TCG Pocket** (mobile game format), which differs from standard TCG:

- **Energy Zone** (1 energy/turn auto-generated, NOT from deck)
- **3-point win condition** (ex Pokemon = 2 pts, regular = 1 pt)
- **3-card bench limit** (not 5 like standard TCG)
- **Turn 1 restrictions** (no draw, no energy, no attack)
