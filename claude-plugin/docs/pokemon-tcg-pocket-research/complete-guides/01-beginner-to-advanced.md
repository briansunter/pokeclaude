# Getting Started

## What is Pokemon TCG Pocket?

Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket is a digital card game based on the Pokemon Trading Card Game, but simplified for mobile play:

- **20-card decks** (vs. 60 in standard TCG)
- **Auto-generating energy** from Energy Zone
- **3-point win condition** (vs. knocking out all Pokemon)
- **Streamlined rules** for faster games (5-10 minutes)

## Quick Start (Your First Game)

### Step 1: Understanding Your Goal

You need to score **3 points** to win:

- Knocking out a **regular Pokemon** = 1 point
- Knocking out an **ex Pokemon** = 2 points

**Winning examples**:

- Knock out 3 regular Pokemon
- Knock out 1 ex Pokemon + 1 regular Pokemon
- Knock out 2 ex Pokemon

### Step 2: Your First Turn

**You go first on Turn 1**:

1. **No draw** (you start with 5 cards)
2. **No energy** (Energy Zone starts Turn 2)
3. **No attack** (can't attack Turn 1)
4. **Play Pokemon** from hand
5. **End turn**

**What you should do**:

- Play a Basic Pokemon if you have one
- Play more Pokemon if you have them
- If you have trainers, consider using them
- End turn

### Step 3: Energy Zone (Turn 2+)

Starting Turn 2, the Energy Zone generates 1 energy per turn:

- **Random type**: Could be any type
- **NOT from your deck**: Your 20 cards are all Pokemon and trainers
- **Use it**: Attach to any of your Pokemon

### Step 4: Attacking

To attack, you need:

1. **Pokemon active** (in play area)
2. **Energy** (from Energy Zone) attached to it
3. **Attack cost met** (e.g., 1 Lightning energy)
4. **Not Turn 1** (can't attack Turn 1)

### Step 5: Winning

Keep knocking out opponent's Pokemon until you reach 3 points!

# Beginner Concepts

## Essential Terminology

### Card Types

- **Basic Pokemon**: Pokemon you can play from hand (minimum 5 per deck)
- **Stage 1 Pokemon**: Evolved from Basic Pokemon
- **Stage 2 Pokemon**: Evolved from Stage 1 Pokemon (strongest)
- **ex Pokemon**: High-HP Pokemon worth 2 points when knocked out
- **Trainer Cards**: Support cards ( Professors, Pokeball, etc.)

### Game Areas

- **Active Pokemon**: The Pokemon fighting in front
- **Bench**: Your backup Pokemon (maximum 3)
- **Energy Zone**: Generates 1 energy per turn (starting Turn 2)
- **Deck**: Your remaining cards
- **Hand**: Cards you're holding

### Actions

- **Evolve**: Turn Basic into Stage 1, Stage 1 into Stage 2
- **Retreat**: Switch your Active Pokemon (costs energy)
- **KO**: Knock out opponent's Pokemon (score points!)
- **Sabrina**: Trainer that forces opponent to switch their Pokemon

## Your First Deck Building Checklist

### ✅ Essential Cards

- [ ] **5-6 Basic Pokemon**: Don't run fewer!
- [ ] **Professor's Research**: Draw 2 cards (always useful)
- [ ] **Pokeball**: Search for Basic Pokemon
- [ ] **Giovanni**: +10 damage to your attacks

### ✅ Good Cards

- [ ] **Sabrina**: Switch opponent's Pokemon
- [ ] **Potion**: Heal 30 damage
- [ ] **Professor Oak**: Draw 3 cards (premium)

### ✅ Pokemon Selection

- [ ] **1-2 Main attackers**: Pokemon you want to use most
- [ ] **Consistent energy types**: All your Pokemon use similar energy (1-2 types max!)
- [ ] **Reasonable HP**: 80+ HP is good, 100+ is great

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake #1: Running Out of Basics

**Problem**: Not enough Basic Pokemon in deck
**Solution**: Play 5-6 minimum, 7-8 is better

### ❌ Mistake #2: Forgetting Energy Zone is Random

**Problem**: Running 3+ energy types, getting wrong energy too often
**Solution**: Stick to 1-2 energy types maximum

**Why 3+ types doesn't work**:

- Energy Zone gives 1 random type per turn
- With 3 types, you only get what you need 33% of the time
- That's only 1 in 3 turns with the right energy!

### ❌ Mistake #3: Over-Benching

**Problem**: Playing too many Pokemon to bench
**Why it's bad**: Only 3 bench slots, and Sabrina can switch your Active Pokemon!

### ❌ Mistake #4: Not Using Giovanni

**Problem**: Missing KO math by not boosting damage
**Solution**: Always use Giovanni before attacking if you have it

### ❌ Mistake #5: Attacking When You Can't KO

**Problem**: Doing chip damage that doesn't help
**Solution**: Attack for lethal, or set up for next turn

## Beginner Strategy: Simple Aggro

### Win Condition

Knock out opponent's Pokemon quickly for 3 points before they set up.

### Deck Composition

```
12-14 Pokemon (mostly Basics)
6-8 Trainers
0 Energy (from Energy Zone)
```

### Play Style

1. **Play attackers fast**: Get damage online quickly
2. **Don't overthink**: Keep it simple
3. **Use Giovanni**: +10 damage changes everything
4. **Heal when needed**: Potion keeps attackers alive

### Simple Deck: Basics Aggro

```
Pokemon (14):
- 4x Zapdos ex
- 4x Pikachu ex
- 2x Raichu
- 4x Plus (or similar Basic Lightning)

Trainers (6):
- 2x Professor's Research
- 2x Pokeball
- 2x Giovanni

Energy: Lightning from Energy Zone
```

# Intermediate Strategy

## Understanding Tempo

Tempo is the "momentum" of the game. Think of it like:

- **Good tempo**: You're always moving forward
- **Bad tempo**: You're falling behind, catching up

### Maintaining Tempo

- **Play threats**: Force opponent to respond
- **Don't waste turns**: Every turn should do something productive
- **Control the board**: Decide the pace of play

### Tempo Swings (Big Plays)

These change who has momentum:

**Professor Oak** (Draw 3 cards)

- Suddenly you're ahead on cards
- Can play multiple threats
- Forces opponent to respond to everything

**Sabrina** (Switch opponent's Pokemon)

- Removes their biggest threat
- Forces them to play something else
- Can turn ex Pokemon into 1-point targets

**Rare Candy** (Skip Stage 1 evolution)

- Gets your powerful Pokemon online early
- Surprises opponent with big attacks
- Skips the "vulnerable" Stage 1 phase

## Card Advantage

Card advantage = having more resources than opponent.

### How to Get Card Advantage

- **Professor's Research**: Draw 2 cards (+2 cards)
- **Professor Oak**: Draw 3 cards (+3 cards)
- **Pokeball**: Find specific cards you need (+efficiency)

### When Card Advantage Matters

- **Late game**: When hands are small
- **Comback scenarios**: When you're behind
- **Maintaining pressure**: When you're ahead

### Card Disadvantage

Avoid falling behind by:

- **Using cards efficiently**: Don't waste cards
- **Not over-extending**: Don't play unnecessary cards
- **Professor timing**: Use professors when you need cards

## Reading Opponents

You can learn a lot from watching opponent behavior:

### What They Play

- **Early professors**: They need cards now
- **Attacking aggressively**: They can KO something
- **Not attacking**: They don't have energy or good attacks
- **Bench protection**: They're worried about Sabrina

### What They Don't Play

- **No evolution**: They don't have evolution cards
- **No professors**: They're saving for later
- **Only Basics**: They're building consistency

### Energy Zone Tracking

Watch what energy they get:

- **Same type every time**: They run 1-type deck
- **Alternating types**: They run 2-type deck
- **If they struggle**: They might be running 3 types (bad!)

## Intermediate Deck Building: Midrange

Midrange decks balance early aggression with late-game power.

### Win Condition

Control the board early, finish with powerful Pokemon late.

### Deck Composition

```
13-15 Pokemon (Basics + Evolutions)
5-7 Trainers
0 Energy (from Energy Zone)
```

### Example: Charizard ex Midrange

```
Pokemon (14):
- 2x Charizard ex
- 2x Charmeleon
- 3x Charmander
- 2x Arcanine
- 2x Growlithe
- 1x Moltres ex

Trainers (6):
- 2x Rare Candy
- 1x Professor Oak
- 1x Professor's Research
- 1x Sabrina
- 1x Giovanni

Energy: Fire from Energy Zone
```

**Strategy**:

1. **Early game**: Play Basics, use Arcanine
2. **Mid game**: Rare Candy into Charizard ex
3. **Late game**: Charizard ex closes the game

### Evolution Timing

#### When to Evolve

- **Immediately**: If you can attack next turn
- **When protected**: If you have bench space
- **For big attacks**: When the attack is worth it

#### When NOT to Evolve

- **Waste of tempo**: If you can't attack afterward
- **No energy**: If you won't be able to use the attack
- **Bad position**: If it will just get Sabrina'd

## KO Math (Intermediate)

Calculate exact damage needed for knockouts:

### The Formula

```
Attack Damage + Giovanni (+10) + Weakness (+30) = Total Damage
Total Damage ≥ Opponent HP = KO
```

### Examples

```
Your attack: 50 damage
With Giovanni: 60 damage
Opponent HP: 70 HP
Result: You can KO them!
```

```
Your attack: 50 damage
With Giovanni: 60 damage
Opponent HP: 80 HP
Result: You need another 20 damage (use X Speed, get help from bench)
```

### Practice Tips

1. **Calculate before attacking**: Know if you can KO
2. **Account for healing**: They might use Potion
3. **Plan multi-turn KOs**: Can you get them in 2 turns? 3?
4. **Factor resistance**: They might resist your type

# Advanced Tactics

## Deep Deck Architecture

### Finding Edge Cases

Every card in your deck should answer "why is this here?":

#### Questions for Every Card

- **What's this card's job?**: Be specific
- **When do I want this card?**: Know the timing
- **What would I cut for it?**: Compare to alternatives
- **Does this replace another card?**: Don't have duplicates

#### Multi-Purpose Cards

Best cards do multiple things:

**Example: Giovanni**

- ✓ Boosts damage
- ✓ Enables OHKOs on Basics
- ✓ Saves turns on ex Pokemon
- ✓ Works with all attackers

**Bad card example**:

- Only works in specific situations
- Requires setup
- Doesn't advance win condition

### Side Board Concepts (Tech Choices)

Since you can't actually sideboard in Pocket, think about:

- **Meta calls**: Cards that beat popular strategies
- **Tech Pokemon**: Pokemon that counter specific types
- **Flex slots**: 1-2 cards you can change based on local meta

#### Common Tech Choices

**Against Fast Decks**:

- High-HP Pokemon
- Potion
- Rocky Helmet
- Stall effects

**Against Control Decks**:

- Fast attackers
- Multiple threats
- Professor Oak
- Energy acceleration

## Advanced Energy Zone Strategy

### Single-Type vs. Dual-Type

#### Single-Type (100% Consistency)

**Pros**:

- Predictable attacks
- Easy to plan
- Reliable tempo

**Cons**:

- Less Pokemon variety
- Vulnerable to weakness
- Predictable to opponents

**Best for**:

- Aggro decks
- New players
- Clear strategies

#### Dual-Type (50% Consistency)

**Pros**:

- More Pokemon options
- Can cover multiple strategies
- Opponent can't predict as well

**Cons**:

- Need backup plans
- 50% chance for each energy
- More complex

**Best for**:

- Midrange decks
- Experienced players
- Flexible strategies

### Energy Zone Probability

#### Single-Type Deck

```
Turn 1: No energy
Turn 2: You get your type (100%)
Turn 3: You get your type (100%)
...consistent every turn!
```

#### Dual-Type Deck

```
Turn 2: 50% Type A, 50% Type B
Turn 3: 50% Type A, 50% Type B
On average: Half your attacks need Type A, half need Type B
```

**Planning**:

- Have Pokemon that work with both types
- Keep at least 2 attackers that can use either energy
- Don't over-commit to one type

## Matchup Mastery

### Learning Specific Matchups

#### Aggro vs. Control

**Aggro plan**:

- Speed is life
- Don't give them time to set up
- Professor Oak to match card draw

**Control plan**:

- Stall and heal
- Force them to overextend
- Sabrina their threats

**Key battle**:

- Can aggro kill before control sets up?
- Can control survive long enough?

#### Mirror Match (Same Deck)

**What matters most**:

- Energy zone luck (you can't control this)
- Tight plays (don't waste cards)
- Opponent disruption (they have same tools you do)

**Strategy**:

- Play for efficiency
- Save disruption for their threats
- Adapt to their play style

### Adapting During Games

#### Signs You Should Switch Strategy

**You're behind on points**:

- Play more aggressively
- Use Professor Oak
- Take risks

**You're ahead on points**:

- Play conservatively
- Deny their KOs
- Close methodically

**Energy zone isn't cooperating**:

- Play more flexible Pokemon
- Use trainers to find specific cards
- Stall until it improves

## High-Level Bluffing

### Information Hiding

#### What to Hide

- **Your plan**: Don't reveal you're building to Stage 2 until ready
- **Your hand**: Use timing to suggest different cards
- **Your disruption**: Save Sabrina for when it hurts most

#### Behavioral Bluffs

- **Pause**: Before obvious plays to suggest uncertainty
- **Quick plays**: When you're confident
- **Vary timing**: Don't be predictable

#### Fake Tells

- Make obvious plays sometimes to suggest weakness
- When you have a strong hand, don't rush
- When you have a weak hand, don't overthink

### Forcing Errors

#### Creating Pressure

- Force opponent to have exact answers
- Make them choose between bad options
- Don't let them play at their pace

#### Example: The Sabrina Trap

1. You have Sabrina but don't use it
2. Opponent plays their ex Pokemon active
3. You wait... and wait...
4. Opponent commits more resources
5. NOW you Sabrina - they lose everything!

**Why it works**: They thought you didn't have it or couldn't use it.

## Tournament-Level Concepts

### Time Management

- Games are 5-10 minutes
- Don't overthink obvious plays
- Make decisions decisively
- Save complex decisions for when they matter

### Mental Game

- **Energy luck happens**: Don't tilt
- **Focus on process**: Make good decisions, not just good outcomes
- **Learn from losses**: What could you have done better?
- **Stay confident**: You can come back from anything

### Deck Selection

- **Meta choices**: Play what beats what's popular
- **Pet decks**: Sometimes off-meta is good
- **Practice**: Know your deck inside and out
- **Comfort**: Play something you enjoy

# Competitive Mindset

## Learning Philosophy

### Process vs. Outcome

**Focus on process** (what you can control):

- ✓ Did you make good decisions?
- ✓ Did you use your resources efficiently?
- ✓ Did you play to your outs?
- ✓ Did you learn something?

**Don't just focus on outcome** (what you can't control):

- ✗ "I lost because energy was unlucky"
- ✗ "I won because opponent made mistake"
- ✗ "My deck is bad"
- ✗ "The meta is broken"

### Growth Mindset

- **Every game is a learning opportunity**
- **Losses teach you more than wins**
- **Good players make good decisions even when they lose**
- **Luck evens out over many games**

## Improving Your Game

### Game Review Process

After each game, ask yourself:

#### Before the Game

1. What was my game plan?
2. What were my backup plans?
3. What did I expect opponent to play?

#### During the Game

1. Did I stick to my plan when it was working?
2. Did I adapt when my plan wasn't working?
3. Where did I waste tempo or cards?
4. Did I calculate KO math correctly?

#### After the Game

1. What could I have done better?
2. What did opponent do well?
3. Is my deck well-built for its strategy?
4. What did I learn?

### Common Areas to Improve

#### Newer Players Focus On:

1. **Basic strategy**: Playing to win condition
2. **Deck consistency**: Enough Basics, good trainers
3. **Resource management**: Not wasting cards
4. **Energy zone understanding**: 1-2 types max

#### Intermediate Players Focus On:

1. **Tempo**: Maintaining and gaining momentum
2. **Card advantage**: Drawing cards efficiently
3. **Reading opponents**: Predicting their plays
4. **Matchup knowledge**: Adapting to different strategies

#### Advanced Players Focus On:

1. **Bluffing**: Information management
2. **Complex line**: Multi-turn planning
3. **Meta adaptation**: Changing strategy based on format
4. **Mental game**: Consistency and confidence

### Practice Drills

#### Drill 1: KO Math

Practice calculating damage needed:

```
Opponent Pokemon: 120 HP
Your attack: 60 damage
Giovanni available: Yes/No
Result: Can you KO?
```

**Do this for every attack!**

#### Drill 2: Energy Tracking

Track opponent's energy types:

```
Turn 2: Fire
Turn 3: Water
Turn 4: Fire
Conclusion: They run Fire/Water dual-type
```

**Predict what they'll get next!**

#### Drill 3: Hand Reading

What can opponent play?

```
They have 4 cards
They drew 1 this turn
They have energy from Zone
What might they do?
```

**Predict their plays!**

#### Drill 4: Tempo Counting

Who has momentum?

```
You played 3 cards last turn
They played 1 card last turn
Who is ahead?
```

**Track who controls the game!**
