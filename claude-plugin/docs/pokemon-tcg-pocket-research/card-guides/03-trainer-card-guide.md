## Introduction

Trainer cards are the backbone of competitive Pokemon TCG Pocket decks. With only 20 cards in your deck and 5-8 trainer slots available, choosing the right trainers can make or break your strategy. This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of every trainer card in Pokemon TCG Pocket, including their effects, rankings, synergy with different archetypes, and budget alternatives.

### Why Trainers Matter

**In Pokemon TCG Pocket, trainer cards are absolutely critical because:**

- **Energy Zone**: With energy auto-generating from the Energy Zone, all 20 deck slots can be Pokemon and trainers
- **Limited Deck Size**: 20 cards means every slot counts - inefficient trainers waste precious space
- **High Power Level**: Many trainers provide game-breaking effects that can swing matches
- **Consistency Tools**: Draw and search trainers make your deck more reliable

**Strengths**:

- **Forces opponent to switch their Pokemon**
- Can dodge attacks for a turn
- Forces opponent to use a bench Pokemon as attacker
- **Combined with 3-bench limit** = major disruption

**Why This Card is Broken**:

- Pokemon TCG Pocket only allows 3 bench slots
- If opponent has 3 bench Pokemon, they cannot switch
- Forces opponent to fight with weakened Active Pokemon
- Can attack weakened Pokemon for easy KOs

**Best Strategies**:

**This card single-handedly defines the metagame.**

Good luck, and may your Professor's Research always find exactly what you need!
