## Tempo and Board Control

### What is Tempo?

Tempo is the pace and momentum of the game. Maintaining tempo means:

- **Always making progress**: Every turn should advance your game plan
- **Forcing responses**: Make your opponent react to you, not vice versa
- **Controlling the board**: Decide when to attack, when to defend, when to switch

### Tempo Plays

#### Opening Tempo (Turns 1-3)

**Your goals**:

- Get a Pokemon active ASAP
- Establish board presence
- Deny opponent's tempo

**Key plays**:

- **Lead with your best attacker**: Don't waste early turns setting up
- **Sabrina usage**: Switch their weak Pokemon with their strong one
- **Aggressive positioning**: Force them to play from behind

**Example**: You have Pikachu ex (90 HP, attacks for 50 with 1 Lightning). Opponent plays a 60 HP Basic. If you have Giovanni (+10), you can knock it out immediately for 1 point.

#### Mid-Game Tempo (Turns 3-5)

**Your goals**:

- Build advantage through trades
- Deny opponent's evolutions
- Control bench slots

**Key concepts**:

- **Tempo swings**: Big plays that change the board state
  - Sabrina: Removes their best attacker
  - Rare Candy: Gets your Stage 2 online a turn early
  - Professor Oak: Refills hand for sustained pressure

**Trade tempo for card advantage**:

- Sometimes it's worth using 2 cards to deny 1 of theirs
- Example: Use Sabrina + Giovanni to knock out their ex (2 cards for 2 points)

#### Closing Tempo (Turns 5-7)

**Your goals**:

- Secure the final points needed
- Deny opponent's comeback
- Convert advantage into victory

**Final point strategies**:

- **Direct route**: Attack for lethal damage
- **Trick route**: Use Sabrina to force their ex to bench (now worth only 1 point)
- **Threat route**: Build unanswerable board state

### Tempo Breaks

Don't break tempo unless you have a clear reason:

#### When to Break Tempo

1. **Setting up a KO**: Sometimes waiting 1 turn to get a powerful attack is worth it
2. **Healing priority**: If your Pokemon can survive multiple turns, healing might be better than attacking
3. **Energy setup**: Building energy for a big turn

#### When NOT to Break Tempo

1. **Chasing damaged Pokemon**: Don't spend turns healing something that's about to die anyway
2. **Defensive plays**: Only stall if you're winning the control game
3. **Card cycling**: Don't draw cards just because you can

## Card Advantage and Resource Management

### Understanding Card Advantage

Card advantage means having more resources than your opponent. In Pokemon TCG Pocket:

- **Draw 2**: Professor's Research = +2 cards vs. opponent
- **Draw 3**: Professor Oak = +3 cards vs. opponent
- **Sabrina**: Forces opponent to use their Active slot
- **Pokeball**: Finds specific cards = efficiency

### The 20-Card Economy

With only 20 cards, each one is precious:

- **Wasted cards lose games**: Every card in your deck should have a clear purpose
- **Discarding is permanent**: No graveyard recursion in Pocket
- **Hand size matters**: Don't hold too many cards (vulnerable to Professor Oak)

### Resource Trading

#### Card-for-Card Trades

- **Your 1 card vs. their 1 card**: Generally even
- **Your 2 cards vs. their 1 card**: Only do this for significant advantage (e.g., KO ex Pokemon)

#### Efficient Resource Usage

**Professor's Research vs. Professor Oak**:

- Professor's Research: Use early to cycle, use late when you have fewer options
- Professor Oak: Save for when you're behind in cards or need specific cards

**Giovanni Math**:

- Cost: 1 card slot for +10 damage
- Value: Often changes 1-2 KO calculations per game
- Verdict: Always worth it in attacker-heavy decks

**Potion Math**:

- Heals 30 damage = often adds 1 extra turn of life
- Value: Can extend Pokemon life for 2-3 attacks
- Verdict: Essential in control decks, good in midrange

### Hand Management

#### What to Keep vs. What to Play

- **Keep setup cards**: Rare Candy, search cards
- **Play tempo cards**: Attackers, disruption
- **Sometimes hold disruption**: Sabrina is better when you see their strategy

#### Playing from Behind

1. **Professor Oak immediately**: Refill hand to find answers
2. **Find your best Pokemon**: Use Pokeball, Pokemon Communication
3. **Stall strategically**: Use Potion, defensive positioning
4. **Force errors**: Make them have exact answers

#### Playing from Ahead

1. **Maintain pressure**: Keep attacking, don't give turns
2. **Denial tools**: Sabrina to remove their threats
3. **Card efficiency**: Don't waste cards on guaranteed wins
4. **Close method**: Decide how you'll get the final point

### Deck Architecture Efficiency

#### Reducing Dead Cards

- **Multi-purpose cards**: Giovanni both boosts damage AND can enable OHKOs
- **Flexible attackers**: 0-energy attacks are never dead
- **Utility Pokemon**: Pokemon with multiple uses

#### Avoiding Card Bloat

- Each slot must pull its weight
- Cut cards that are situational
- Focus on core strategy

## Energy Zone Mastery

### Predicting the Energy Zone

The Energy Zone generates 1 random energy per turn. Understanding this is critical:

#### Probability with 1 Energy Type

- **100% chance** it's your type
- **Guaranteed**: You can plan attacks reliably
- **Strategy**: Build mono-type decks

#### Probability with 2 Energy Types

- **50% chance** for either type
- **Planning**: Need both types to be useful
- **Backup plans**: Have attacks that work with either energy

#### Probability with 3 Energy Types

- **33% chance** for any specific type
- **Inconsistency**: Only get the right energy 1 in 3 turns
- **Verdict**: Don't do this

### Energy Zone-Based Gameplay

#### Turn 2 Planning

Even though you don't control the energy type, you can plan:

- **On Turn 1**: Set up Pokemon that work with multiple types
- **Predict Turn 2**: Have backup options
- **Don't overcommit**: Don't play all high-cost Pokemon if you might not get energy

#### Multi-Type Deck Building

**Fire/Water Example**:

- Have attacks that only need Fire OR only need Water
- Have a few attacks that need both (but expect them rarely)
- Bench Pokemon that are flexible

**Offensive Flexibility**:

```
Pokemon A: Attacks for 50 with 1 Fire
Pokemon B: Attacks for 50 with 1 Water
Result: 50% chance for either 50-damage attack
```

**Defensive Flexibility**:

```
Pokemon A: Weakness is Water
Pokemon B: Weakness is Grass
Result: Opponent's energy type helps determine which is safer
```

#### The Rare Candy Exception

Rare Candy evolution bypasses energy requirements:

- **Basic to Stage 2**: Often skips needing energy for Stage 1
- **Value**: Can enable powerful attacks sooner
- **Strategy**: Plan Rare Candy turns when energy zone helps

### Energy Denial Strategies

#### Knowing When You Don't Need Energy

- **0-energy attacks**: Always available
- **Pokemon switches**: Don't need energy
- **Trainers**: Don't need energy

#### Surviving Bad Energy Luck

- **Multiple attackers**: Different energy requirements
- **Switch Pokemon**: Use low-retreat-cost Pokemon
- **Stall tactics**: Buy time for energy to align

## Reading Opponents

### Information Available

Every turn gives you information:

- **What they drew**: 1 new card (unless Turn 1)
- **Energy zone result**: You see what energy they got
- **What they played**: Every action is public
- **What's left**: Track what they've used

### Hand Reading

#### What's in Their Hand?

**Clues**:

- **How many cards**: Count when possible
- **Card types**: Trainer icons vs. Pokemon silhouettes
- **Behavior**: Do they seem confident or hesitant?

**Common hands**:

- **Professor Oak = 3 cards**: Very strong, likely to change game state
- **3+ Basics**: Consistent, can replace benched Pokemon
- **0 Pokemon**: Relying on evolved forms or trainers

#### Predicting Their Play

**Turn structure**:

1. They drew 1 card this turn
2. They got 1 energy from zone
3. They can now play cards and attack

**If they don't attack**:

- No Pokemon in play
- No energy for attacks
- Saving energy for bigger play
- Waiting for evolution

**If they don't evolve**:

- No evolution cards
- Saving for better opportunity
- Evolving would waste tempo

### Opponent's Energy Tracking

Track their energy type each turn:

- **Pattern recognition**: Do they run 1-type or 2-type?
- **Predictability**: If they need specific energy, you know what they want
- **Disruption**: Force them into bad energy types with Sabrina

### Reading Trainer Usage

#### When They Save Trainers

- **Sabrina saved**: Waiting for your best Pokemon
- **Professor Oak saved**: Need cards now
- **Giovanni saved**: Planning KO

#### Trainer Timing

- **Early professors**: Trying to find specific cards
- **Late professors**: Running out of options
- **Immediate trainer**: Had perfect answer

### Adaptive Play

#### Change Your Plan Based on Reads

- **They have Sabrina**: Don't over-bench important Pokemon
- **They have Professor Oak**: Play aggressively to deny cards
- **They draw well**: Play more conservatively
- **They draw poorly**: Press advantage

#### Bluffing

**False tells**:

- Pause before obvious plays to suggest uncertainty
- Don't always take obvious lines
- Make them question what you have

**Information control**:

- Don't reveal your entire game plan
- Save key cards for when they matter
- Use obvious plays to disguise traps

## KO Math and Damage Calculation

### Understanding KO Math

KO math is calculating exact damage needed to knock out Pokemon. This is crucial for:

- **Efficient attacks**: Don't waste damage
- **Giovanni usage**: Know when +10 changes everything
- **Switch decisions**: Know when to retreat

### Base Damage Calculation

#### Pokemon HP Ranges

- **Basic Pokemon**: Typically 60-90 HP
- **Stage 1 Pokemon**: Typically 80-120 HP
- **Stage 2 Pokemon**: Typically 120-180 HP
- **ex Pokemon**: Typically 150-200+ HP

#### Attack Damage

- **30 damage**: Needs 90 total to KO 120 HP Pokemon
- **40 damage**: Needs 80 total to KO 120 HP Pokemon
- **50 damage**: Needs 70 total to KO 120 HP Pokemon
- **60 damage**: Needs 60 total to KO 120 HP Pokemon

### Giovanni Modifier (+10 Damage)

Giovanni adds +10 to ALL your Pokemon's attacks. This changes KO thresholds:

#### Without Giovanni (50 damage attack)

- **KO 60 HP**: 10 damage overkill
- **KO 70 HP**: 20 damage overkill
- **Need HP 51+**: Can't KO 60 HP Basic

#### With Giovanni (60 damage attack)

- **KO 70 HP**: 10 damage overkill
- **KO 80 HP**: 20 damage overkill
- **Need HP 61+**: Can now KO 60 HP Basic

**Key insight**: Giovanni effectively reduces every Pokemon's HP by 10 for KO calculations.

### Weakness and Resistance

#### Weakness

- **Adds 30 damage**: If opponent is weak to your type
- **Examples**:
  - Grass takes +30 from Fire
  - Water takes +30 from Lightning
  - Psychic takes +30 from Darkness

#### Resistance

- **Subtracts 30 damage**: If you're resistant to opponent's type
- **Examples**:
  - Fighting takes -30 from Psychic
  - Metal takes -30 from Fire
  - Water takes -30 from Grass

### KO Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: KO a Basic Pokemon

```
Your Pokemon: 60 HP attack
Opponent's Basic: 70 HP
Without Giovanni: Can't KO (60 < 70)
With Giovanni: Can KO (60+10 = 70)
```

**Decision**: Use Giovanni before attacking if needed for KO.

#### Scenario 2: KO an ex Pokemon

```
Your Pokemon: 80 damage attack
Opponent's ex: 150 HP
Without Giovanni: 70 damage remaining
With Giovanni: 90 damage remaining

Need attacks:
- 2 more 80-damage attacks (without G)
- 2 more 60-damage attacks (with G)
```

**Decision**: Factor Giovanni into multi-turn KO plans.

#### Scenario 3: Using Weakness

```
Your Fire Pokemon vs. Grass Pokemon
Attack: 50 damage
Weakness: +30 damage
Total: 80 damage

Can KO 70 HP Basic immediately
```

**Decision**: Exploit type matchups aggressively.

### Retreat Cost and Switching

#### Low Retreat Cost (0-1)

- **Easy to switch**: Good for tempo
- **Use for**: Active Pokemon that get targeted
- **Examples**: Zapdos ex (0), many Basics

#### High Retreat Cost (2-3)

- **Hard to switch**: Stay active longer
- **Plan around**: Make sure attacks are worth it
- **Healing priority**: Don't want to retreat anyway

#### Switching Math

Sometimes it's worth taking damage to switch:

- **Opponent attacks for 30**: If healing 60, don't switch
- **Opponent Sabrina next turn**: Might be worth taking 20 to avoid switch

### Multi-Turn KO Planning

#### Set Up the KO

1. **Calculate total damage needed**
2. **Plan Giovanni timing**
3. **Account for potential healing**
4. **Consider opponent disruption**

#### Example: KO 150 HP ex Pokemon

```
Turn 1: Attack for 60, 90 HP remaining
Turn 2: Attack for 60, 30 HP remaining
Turn 3: Attack for 30, KO

With Giovanni:
Turn 1: 70 damage, 80 HP remaining
Turn 2: 70 damage, 10 HP remaining
Turn 3: Attack for anything, KO

Savings: 1 turn with Giovanni
```

## Advanced Trainer Usage

### Professor's Research (Draw 2)

#### Best Uses

- **Turn 1**: Cycle through deck, find Basics
- **Turn 2-3**: Find specific cards you need
- **Late game**: Find win conditions

#### Mistakes to Avoid

- **Wasting it early**: Don't use if you have good hand
- **Not using it**: Don't hold too long, cards are finite
- **Using on empty deck**: Almost lost, might as well try

### Professor Oak (Draw 3)

#### Premium Situations

- **Card disadvantage**: Opponent has more cards
- **Desperation**: Need specific cards now
- **Overwhelming advantage**: Refill to maintain pressure

#### Timing Considerations

- **Save for late game**: When every card matters
- **Don't waste on good hand**: Save for when you need it
- **Opponent response**: They might have their own professor

### Sabrina (Switch Opponent's Pokemon)

#### Power Plays

1. **Move ex to bench**: Now worth only 1 point instead of 2
2. **Force bad matchup**: Put weak Pokemon against strong attacker
3. **Break evolution**: Make them re-evolve
4. **Disrupt tempo**: Waste their setup

#### Strategic Uses

- **Early game**: If they have good start, disrupt it
- **Mid-game**: Remove their best attacker
- **Late game**: Force their ex to bench = easier final point

#### Advanced Tactics

- **Fakeout**: Make them play aggressively, then Sabrina
- **Bench bait**: Leave weak Pokemon active to bait, then Sabrina their real threat
- **Timing**: Save until they commit resources to active Pokemon

### Cyrus (Switch + 20 Damage)

#### Versatile Tool

#### When You're Disadvantaged

- **Healing priority**: Keep Pokemon alive longer
- **Sabrina denial**: Don't let them exploit weakness
- **Switch to resistance**: If possible

## Late Game Tactics

### Understanding the Endgame

Games typically end in 5-7 turns. The late game (turns 4-7) is about:

- **Securing final points**: Getting to 3 points
- **Denying opponent's points**: Preventing them from reaching 3
- **Resource management**: Cards are running low

### Final Point Strategies

#### Scenario A: You Have 2 Points

```
You need: 1 more point
Opponent: Has 1 point

Your options:
1. Attack for KO (reliable)
2. Sabrina their ex to bench (now worth 1)
3. Build unanswerable threat
```

**Analysis**:

- **Attack**: Direct route, requires damage
- **Sabrina**: Forces them to have 2 points worth
- **Threat**: Make them need to find specific answers

#### Scenario B: You Have 1 Point, Opponent Has 2

```
You need: 2 points (can't risk them getting 3)
Opponent: Has 1 point (can win next turn)

Your options:
1. Fast double KO (2 KOs this turn)
2. Sabrina their ex + attack
3. Defend and counter-attack
```

**Analysis**:

- **Fast double**: Requires powerful board state
- **Sabrina trick**: Use their ex against them
- **Defend**: Risky but might force misplay

### Card Efficiency in Late Game

#### Professors in Late Game

- **Professor's Research**: Use when you need 2 specific cards
- **Professor Oak**: Use when you need 3 cards or are far behind

#### Don't Waste Cards

- **Healing dead Pokemon**: Don't heal something that won't survive
- **Attacking for no reason**: Only attack if it matters
- **Playing unnecessary cards**: Save for when they matter

### Opponent's Endgame

#### What They're Trying to Do

- **Track points**: Know how close each of you is
- **Count their resources**: How many KOs do they need?
- **Disrupt your plan**: Sabrina, healing denial

#### Denying Their Plan

- **Keep track**: Know exactly what they need
- **Don't give easy KOs**: Heal, Sabrina, switch
- **Force them to overextend**: Make them use resources

### Comeback Scenarios

#### Down 0-2 Points

```
You have: 0 points
Opponent: 2 points

Your strategy:
1. Professor Oak immediately
2. Find your best Pokemon
3. Heal/stall strategically
4. Force them to make mistakes
```

**Key concepts**:

- **Desperation plays**: All-in on professor
- **Healing priority**: Every turn matters
- **Opponent pressure**: Make them anxious to close

#### Final Turn Scenarios

- **You can win**: Attack for KO
- **You must defend**: Heal, Sabrina, counter
- **Both can win**: Calculate who has advantage

## Mind Games and Bluffing

### Information Asymmetry

### Strategic Disruption

#### Sabrina Bluffing

- **Hold Sabrina**: Make them play safely
- **Use Sabrina early**: Force them to play safe later
- **Fakeout with other trainers**: Make them guess

#### Professor Bluffing

- **Save Professor Oak**: Suggest you have it
- **Use Professor's Research**: Make them think you don't have Oak
- **Timing**: Use professors unpredictably

### Advanced Psychology

#### Creating Pressure

- **Force decisions**: Make them have exact answers
- **Time pressure**: Play at reasonable pace but don't rush
- **Resource pressure**: Make every card count

#### Managing Tilt

- **Your tilt**: Energy luck happens, stay focused
- **Opponent tilt**: Sometimes let obvious wins happen
- **Don't tilt-punish**: Play well regardless of luck

## Conclusion
