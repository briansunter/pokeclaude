# Pokemon TCG Pocket: Complete Deck Building Guide

## Deck Building Fundamentals

### Core Principles

#### 1. Consistency is King

With only 20 cards, every slot matters. Your deck should have:

- **Clear strategy**: Know how you want to win
- **Multiple win conditions**: Don't rely on one card
- **Consistent energy**: 1-2 types maximum
- **Smooth draws**: Access to Basic Pokemon

#### 2. The Energy Zone Changes Everything

The Energy Zone (auto-generates 1 energy/turn) fundamentally alters deck building:

- **No energy in deck**: All 20 cards can be Pokemon and trainers
- **Random generation**: Plan for inconsistency
- **1 Type = 100% consistency**: Best option if your strategy allows
- **2 Types = 50/50**: Good balance of consistency and flexibility
- **3 Types = 33/33/33**: AVOID - too inconsistent

#### 3. Bench Constraints

Only 3 bench slots means:

- Every bench Pokemon must earn its place
- Cannot rely on benched evolved Pokemon
- Basic Pokemon on bench are at risk from Sabrina

## Deck Archetypes

## Deck Building Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Strategy

Ask yourself:

- Do I want to win fast or slow?
- Do I want to control or be controlled?
- What energy types work for my strategy?
- What Pokemon do I enjoy playing?

### Step 2: Select Core Pokemon (8-10 cards)

- **Main Attacker** (1-2 copies): Your primary win condition
- **Support Pokemon** (3-4 cards): Pokemon that help your strategy
- **Consistency cards** (2-3 cards): Easy-to-play Pokemon

### Step 3: Add Evolution Lines (4-6 cards)

- **Basics for evolution** (2-3 cards): Needed to evolve
- **Stage 1s** (1-2 cards): Mid-stage evolutions
- **Stage 2s** (1-2 cards): Powerful finishers
- **Rare Candy** (1-2 cards): Skip Stage 1 for faster evolution

### Step 4: Add Trainers (5-8 cards)

**Essential staples** (choose 3-4):

- Professor's Research: Draw 2 cards
- Pokeball: Search Basic Pokemon
- Professor Oak: Draw 3 cards (very strong)
- Sabrina: Disrupt opponent
- Giovanni: +10 damage for KO math

**Tech cards** (choose 2-4):

- Potion: Healing
- X Speed: +10 damage
- Pokemon Communication: Search evolutions
- Rare Candy: Stage 2 acceleration
- Giant Cape: +20 HP
- Rocky Helmet: 20 damage to attacker

### Step 5: Energy Planning

- **1 Energy Type**: Choose if your Pokemon mostly use one type
- **2 Energy Types**: Most flexible option
- **3+ Energy Types**: AVOID - too inconsistent

### Step 6: Test and Refine

- Play 10-20 games
- Note problems:
  - Not enough Basics?
  - Too many high-cost Pokemon?
  - Running out of cards?
  - Energy inconsistencies?

## Pokemon Selection Guide

### What Makes a Good Pokemon?

#### Offensive Stats

- **High HP**: Survive multiple attacks (80+ HP is good)
- **Efficient attacks**: Low energy cost, high damage

- Essential in evolution decks
- Can find Rare Candy or evolution pieces

### Damage Modification

**Giovanni**

- +10 damage to all your Pokemon's attacks
- Changes KO math significantly
- Essential in most decks

**X Speed**

- +10 damage to one Pokemon
- More specific than Giovanni
- Good for OHKOs

### Disruption

**Sabrina**

- Force opponent to switch Active Pokemon
- Can move opponent's ex Pokemon to bench (worth only 1 point!)
- Powerful disruption tool

**Cyrus**

- Switch opponent's Pokemon + do 20 damage
- Versatile effect

### Acceleration

**Rare Candy**

- Evolve Basic directly to Stage 2
- Skips Stage 1
- Essential for Stage 2 decks

## Energy Zone Strategy

### Why 1-2 Types Maximum?

The Energy Zone generates 1 random energy per turn. With 2 types, you have 50% chance each turn for the type you need. With 3 types, you only have 33% chance - that's only 1 in 3 turns you'll get the right energy!

### Single-Type Decks

**Pros**:

- 100% energy consistency
- Easy to plan attacks
- Reliable turn-to-turn

**Cons**:

- Less flexible
- Vulnerable to weakness exploitation
- Limited Pokemon pool

**Best For**:

- Aggro decks
- New players
- Decks with clear energy requirements

### Dual-Type Decks

**Pros**:

- More Pokemon options
- Can cover multiple strategies
- Flexibility in game plan

**Cons**:

- 50/50 energy luck
- Need to plan for both types
- More complex

**Best For**:

- Midrange decks
- Experienced players
- Decks needing flexibility

### Building Energy Zones

#### Fire-type Example

- **Core**: Charizard ex, Arcanine, Charmander
- **Support**: Moltres ex, Rapidash
- **Trainers**: Professor Oak, Giovanni, Sabrina
- **Energy**: 100% Fire from Zone

#### Water-type Example

- **Core**: Blastoise, Starmie, Vaporeon
- **Support**: Gyarados, Slowbro
- **Trainers**: Professor's Research, Potion, X Speed
- **Energy**: 100% Water from Zone

#### Lightning-type Example

- **Core**: Pikachu ex, Zapdos ex, Raichu
- **Support**: Electrode, Magneton
- **Trainers**: Pokeball, Giovanni, Professor Oak
- **Energy**: 100% Lightning from Zone

## Testing and Iteration

### Initial Testing Questions

1. Can I consistently get a Basic Pokemon on Turn 1?
2. Do I have enough draw power?
3. Can I make it to my late-game Pokemon?
4. Do my attacks connect for lethal damage?
5. Do I have enough disruption?

### Common Deck Building Mistakes

#### Too Many High-Cost Pokemon

- Problem: Can't attack early
- Solution: More Basics and low-cost attackers

#### Not Enough Basics

- Problem: Starting hands are weak
- Solution: Add 1-2 more Basics

#### Too Many Trainers

- Problem: No room for Pokemon
- Solution: Cut trainers, focus on essentials

#### No Card Draw

- Problem: Run out of cards
- Solution: Add Professor's Research

#### Energy Inconsistency

- Problem: Wrong energy types generated
- Solution: Reduce to 1-2 types maximum

### Iterative Improvements

Track these metrics over 10 games:

- **Starting hand strength**: 7+/10, 5-6/10, or <5/10
- **Turn 2-3 plays**: What can you do?
- **Energy luck**: How often do you get right type?
- **Card draw**: Do you have enough cards?
- **Win rate**: Are you winning ~50% of games?

Make small changes (2-3 cards at a time) and test again.

## Meta Considerations

### Adapting to the Meta

If aggro is popular:

- Add more healing (Potion)
- Add disruption (Sabrina)
- Increase HP (Giant Cape)

If control is popular:

- Add faster attackers
- Reduce reliance on Stage 2s
- Include Professor Oak

If Stage 2s are popular:

- Include Rare Candy
- Add energy acceleration
- Include disruption to slow opponents

### Counter-Strategy Building

When building to beat a specific strategy:

- Identify their win condition
- Choose Pokemon that exploit their weaknesses
- Include disruption cards
- Plan your energy for consistency

## Budget Deck Building

### Building on a Budget

#### Use Commons and Uncommons

- Rares and ex cards aren't necessary
- Many effective decks use mostly commons
- Focus on synergies, not rarity

#### Essential vs. Non-Essential

**Always include**:

- Professor's Research
- Basics appropriate to your strategy
- 1-2 evolution lines

**Nice to have**:

- Professor Oak
- ex Pokemon
- Rare Candy
- Multiple disruption cards

#### Build in Phases

1. Start with Basics + Professor's Research (12 cards)
2. Add evolution line + consistency cards (5 cards)
3. Add trainers and tech (3 cards)

## Deck List Examples

### Example 1: Pikachu ex Aggro

```
Pokemon (14):
- 4x Pikachu ex
- 3x Raichu
- 3x Pichu
- 4x Plus (basic Lightning)

Trainers (6):
- 2x Professor's Research
- 2x Pokeball
- 2x Giovanni

Energy: From Energy Zone (Lightning only)
```

### Example 2: Charizard ex Midrange

```
Pokemon (14):
- 2x Charizard ex
- 2x Charmeleon
- 3x Charmander
- 2x Arcanine
- 2x Growlithe
- 2x Vulpix
- 1x Moltres ex

Trainers (6):
- 2x Rare Candy
- 1x Professor Oak
- 1x Professor's Research
- 1x Sabrina
- 1x Giovanni

Energy: From Energy Zone (Fire only)
```

## Conclusion

Deck building in Pokemon TCG Pocket is about balancing:

- **Consistency** vs. **Power**
- **Speed** vs. **Resilience**
- **Simplicity** vs. **Complexity**

Start simple with a clear strategy, test extensively, and make small improvements. The Energy Zone is the most important factor - get that right, and your deck will perform reliably.

Remember: The best deck is one you can play consistently well, not necessarily the most powerful on paper.
