# DECK ARCHETYPES: Complete Strategy Guide

## Executive Summary

- 5 major archetypes in Pokemon TCG Pocket meta
- How to build, play, and counter each archetype
- Meta positioning and win conditions
- Skill requirements and difficulty ratings
- When to choose each archetype

## HOW ARCHETYPES WORK IN POKEMON TCG POCKET

### Format Differences from Standard TCG

**Pocket Format (20 cards)**:

- Faster games (4-6 turns average)
- More variance (smaller deck size)
- Less consistent draw (only 20 cards)
- **Critical**: Each archetype must win by turn 6-8

**Implications for Archetypes**:

- Aggro is more viable (less time for control)
- Combo is harder (less search/draw)
- Midrange dominates (balanced approach)
- Control limited (only 20 turns to win)

### Energy Zone Impact

- **Auto-generation** means all decks start equal on energy
- No energy ramping from deck
- Sabotna #1 disruption tool (forces wrong Pokemon)
- Energy zone reading predicts all plays

---

## AGGRO DECKS (Fast Burn/Damage)

### Core Philosophy

**Win Condition**: Deal 3 points of damage before opponent establishes defense

**Game Plan**:

- Turn 1: Setup basic Pokemon
- Turn 2: Prepare evolution
- Turn 3: Strike with first attack
- Turn 4-5: Lethal damage (200+)
- **Goal**: Win by turn 5-6

### Archetype: FIRE AGGRO (Charizard ex)

**Why It Works**:

- Charizard ex has 200 damage attack
- Only requires 3 energy (achievable turn 3)
- Multiple variants for consistency
- Fast, unforgiving pressure

**Complete Deck List**:

```
POKEMON (10):
- 2x Charizard ex (A4b #59/#361)
- 2x Charmander (any set)
- 2x Charmeleon (any set)
- 2x Pidgey (filler/search)
- 1x Pidgeotto (evolution option)
- 1x Rattata (filler)

TRAINERS (10):
- 4x Professor's Research (draw)
- 4x Poké Ball (search)
- 2x Sabrina (disruption)

ENERGY: 0 (auto-generated)
```

**Gameplay Timeline**:

```
Turn 1 (0 Energy):
- Play Charmander (70 HP)
- Use Poké Ball if needed for search
- Goal: Get basic in play

Turn 1 (0 Energy):
- Play second Pokemon (Pidgey)
- Set up for evolution line

Turn 2 (1 Energy):
- Use Poké Ball to find Charmeleon OR evolve Charmander
- Draw cards with Professor's Research
- Never attack (only 1 energy, 30 damage = useless)

Turn 3 (2 Energy):
- EVOLUTION TURN: Charizard ex
- Attach 1R energy to Charizard
- 1 energy in Zone for future
- Can attack for 60 (RCC Slash)
- But usually wait for turn 4

Turn 4 (3 Energy):
- Attach second energy (2R total)
- RCC Slash: 60 damage
- If opponent at 1 point, push for 2nd point
- If opponent healthy, build for lethal

Turn 5 (4 Energy):
- RRCC Crimson Storm: 200 DAMAGE (LETHAL)
- 99% of games end here
- Opponent cannot survive 200 damage
```

**Mulligan Strategy**:
**Keep**:

- Charmander (essential)
- Any basic + Poké Ball
- Professor's Research (draw)

**Never Keep**:

- Charizard ex (need evolution line)
- Only trainer cards
- High-HP basics without evolution

**Matchup Spread**:

- vs Control: 80% win (too fast to disrupt)
- vs Midrange: 75% win (outpaces them)
- vs Aggro Mirror: 60% win (who gets setup first)
- vs Combo: 85% win (they can't execute)

**Tech Choices**:

```
Option 1: Giovanni Package
- Add 2x Giovanni
- Replaces 2x Pidgey
- Purpose: Energy acceleration (turn 4 lethal possible)
- Risk: Less search, more variance

Option 2: Sabrina Package
- Add 1x Sabrina
- Replaces 1x Pidgeotto
- Purpose: Disrupt opponent's evolution
- Risk: Less consistent, more skill required

Option 3: Pure Aggro
- 2x Charizard ex, 2x Charmander, 2x Charmeleon
- 6x Pidgey (filler)
- 4x Professor's Research, 4x Poké Ball
- Purpose: Maximum consistency
- Risk: Vulnerable to disruption
```

**Common Mistakes**:

1. **Attacking turn 3** with Charmeleon (30 damage = waste)
2. **Evolving too slow** (waiting for more energy)
3. **No backup plan** (all eggs in Charizard basket)
4. **Sabrina misuse** (using when opponent can't attack)
5. **Energy waste** (not keeping 1 in Zone)

### Archetype: LIGHTNING AGGRO (Pikachu ex Swarm)

**Why It Works**:

- Circle Circuit scales with benched Pokemon
- 30 damage × 5 benched = 150 damage
- Fast setup (no evolution line required)
- Multiple variants in different sets

**Complete Deck List**:

```
POKEMON (12):
- 4x Pikachu ex (mix variants)
- 4x Pikachu (basic)
- 2x Voltorb (energy support)
- 2x Electrode (energy support)

TRAINERS (8):
- 4x Professor's Research
- 3x Poké Ball
- 1x Sabrina

ENERGY: 0 (auto-generated)
```

**Gameplay Timeline**:

```
Turn 1 (0 Energy):
- Play Pikachu (60 HP)
- Setup for turn 2

Turn 2 (1 Energy):
- Play second Pikachu (bench for scaling)
- Use Professor's Research
- Build bench

Turn 3 (2 Energy):
- Activate Pikachu ex
- Attach 2L energy
- Circle Circuit: 60 damage (2 benched)
- Build for scaling

Turn 4 (3 Energy):
- Add third Pokemon to bench
- Circle Circuit: 90 damage (3 benched)
- Pressure continues

Turn 5 (4 Energy):
- Add fourth/fifth Pokemon
- Circle Circuit: 120-150 damage
- LETHAL THREAT

Turn 6 (5 Energy):
- 5 benched: 150 damage LETHAL
- If not dead, they will be
```

**Scaling Math**:

```
Benched Lightning Pokemon → Damage
1 benched: 30 damage (base)
2 benched: 60 damage
3 benched: 90 damage
4 benched: 120 damage
5 benched: 150 damage (MAX)
```

**Strengths**:

- Scales automatically
- Hard to disrupt (no single point of failure)
- Multiple win conditions
- Fast (turn 6 lethal)

**Weaknesses**:

- Sabrina cuts off scaling
- Vulnerable to bench wipe
- Requires board positioning
- More complex than Charizard

**Matchup Spread**:

- vs Control: 72% win (outpaces them)
- vs Midrange: 68% win (scaling beats midrange)
- vs Aggro: 75% win (faster than most)
- vs Combo: 78% win (combo can't execute)

## CONTROL DECKS (Resource Denial)

### Core Philosophy

**Win Condition**: Outlast opponent, control tempo, deny resources

**Game Plan**:

- Turn 1-3: Survive and setup
- Turn 4-6: Establish control
- Turn 7+: Grind opponent

**Critical Challenge**:

- 20-card format limits control options
- Most games end by turn 8
- Must win before opponent times out

### Archetype: WATER CONTROL (Blastoise ex)

- 3 retreat cost stalls opponent
- High damage potential (160)
- Late-game victory
- Forces unfavorable trades

**Complete Deck List**:

```
POKEMON (10):
- 2x Blastoise ex (A3 #232/A4b #087)
- 2x Squirtle (basic)
- 2x Wartortle (stage 1)
- 2x Psyduck (draw engine)
- 2x Slowpoke (stall)

TRAINERS (10):
- 4x Professor's Research

- First attack: 160 damage (100 + 60 with 2 extra W)
- 1 point scored
- 3 retreat cost stalls opponent

Turn 5+ (4+ Energy):
- Continue 160 damage attacks
- Use Switch to maintain retreat advantage
- Opponent cannot retreat efficiently
- Win by sustained pressure
```

**Retreat Math**:

```
Blastoise ex Retreat Cost: 3
Opponent Retreat Options:
- 0 cost Pokemon: Can retreat
- 1 cost Pokemon: Struggles
- 2 cost Pokemon: Can't retreat
- 3 cost Pokemon: Same as Blastoise

Strategy:
- Make opponent's Pokemon unable to retreat
- Force them to take bad exchanges
- Use Sabrina to swap in unfavorable matchups
```

**Strengths**:

- vs Combo: 75% win (disruption effective)

### Control Archetype Limitations

**Why Control is Hard in Pocket**:

```
Problem 1: Small Deck (20 cards)
- Limited search/draw options
- Hard to find control pieces
- Variance is higher

Problem 2: Fast Format
- Games end by turn 8
- Control needs 10-15 turns to win
- Race to 3 points is faster

Problem 3: Limited Control Tools
- Only Sabrina for tempo control
- No persistent disruption
- Healing is limited

Solution: Hybrid Decks
- Control elements in aggro/midrange
- E.g., Sabrina in Charizard deck
- E.g., healing in Mewtwo deck
```

### Viable Control Options

**Option 1: Sabrina Package**

```
Add 2-3x Sabrina to any deck
Purpose: Tempo control
Works In: All archetypes
Best With: High retreat cost Pokemon

Example:
- 2x Sabrina in Charizard
- Denies opponent's evolution
- Buys extra turn for setup
```

**Option 2: Healing Package**

```
Add 1-2x Potion/Giovanni
Purpose: Sustainability
Works In: Midrange/Control
Best With: High-HP Pokemon

Example:
- 2x Giovanni in Venusaur
- Healing + acceleration
- Outlasts everything
```

**Option 3: Switch Package**

```
Add 2x Switch
Purpose: Retreat advantage
Works In: Control mirrors
Best With: High retreat cost

Example:
- 2x Switch in Blastoise
- Opponent can't retreat
- Forces bad trades
```

## COMBO DECKS (Synergy Engine)

### Core Philosophy

**Win Condition**: Execute specific combo for instant victory

**Critical Challenge**:

- 20-card deck reduces combo consistency
- Limited search/draw tools
- Most combos unreliable

### Why Combo is Rare in Pocket

**Problems**:

1. **No Energy Search** - cannot tutor combo pieces
2. **Limited Draw** - only Professor's Research
3. **No Power Cosmic** - no game-winning items
4. **Too Fast** - combo can't execute in 4-5 turns

**Viable Combos**:

**Synergy 1: Pikachu ex Bench Scale**

```
Combo Pieces:
- 4x Pikachu ex
- 4x Pikachu (basic)
- Multiple energy generators

Execution:
- Turn 1: Pikachu
- Turn 2-3: Build bench
- Turn 4: Activate ex
- Turn 5-6: Lethal Circle Circuit

Reliability: 75% (good)
Meta Position: A-Tier
```

**Synergy 2: Evolution Rush**

```
Combo Pieces:
- 2x Rare Candy
- Charizard/Blastoise/Venusaur line
- Evolution support

Execution:
- Turn 1: Basic
- Turn 2: Rare Candy to Stage 2

**Choosing Your Archetype**:

- New Player → Aggro (Charizard)
- Experienced → Midrange (Venusaur)
- High Skill → Control (Blastoise)
- Unique Play → Combo (Pikachu)

**Next Steps**:

1. Choose ONE archetype to master
2. Build it following templates
3. Play 50 games minimum
4. Study matchup-specific guides
5. Experiment with tech choices
6. Master your chosen deck before branching out
