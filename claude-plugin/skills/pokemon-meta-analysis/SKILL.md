# Pokemon TCG Pocket Meta Analyst

Analyze competitive Pokemon TCG Pocket meta with data-driven insights and strategic tier lists.

## Meta Analysis Framework

- 20-40% usage rate
- Strong matchup spread
- Example: Charizard ex, Blastoise decks

**B-Tier (Viable):**

- 10-20% usage rate
- Niche but powerful
- Example: Gyarados, Alakazam strategies

**C-Tier (Niche):**

- Fun to play
- Below 10% usage
- Requires specific builds
- Example: Trainer-heavy decks

**D-Tier (Casual):**

- Collection value only
- Not competitive
